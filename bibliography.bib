Furthermore, we argue that a fully functional, virtual replica of a CPS can also play an important role in securing the system. In this work, we present a framework that allows users to create and execute digital twins, closely matching their physical counterparts. We focus on a novel approach to automatically generate the virtual environment from specification, taking advantage of engineering data exchange formats. From a security perspective, an identical (in terms of the system's specification), simulated environment can be freely explored and tested by security professionals, without risking negative impacts on live systems. Going a step further, security modules on top of the framework support security analysts in monitoring the current state of CPSs. We demonstrate the viability of the framework in a proof of concept, including the automated generation of digital twins and the monitoring of security and safety rules.},

  abstract  = {Digital twins play a key role in realizing the vision of a smart factory. While this concept is often associated with maintenance, optimization, and simulation, digital twins can also be leveraged to enhance the security and safety of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). In particular, digital twins can run in parallel to a CPS, allowing to perform a security and safety analysis during operation without the risk of disrupting live systems. However, replicating states of physical devices within a CPS in functionally equivalent virtual replicas, so that they precisely mirror the internal behavior of their counterparts, is an open research topic. In this paper, we propose a novel state replication approach that first identifies stimuli based on the system's specification and then replicates them in a virtual environment. We believe that replicating states of CPSs is a prerequisite for a multitude of security and safety enhancing features that can be implemented on the basis of digital twins. To demonstrate the feasibility of the specification-based state replication approach, we provide a prototypical implementation and evaluate it in an experimental CPS test bed. The results of this paper show that attacks against CPSs can be successfully detected by leveraging the proposed state replication approach.},

This requires a redesign of existing information processing systems especially related to control, leading possibly to cyber-physical production systems (CPPS). However, the implementation of new control technologies will have a direct impact on the normal operational status of production while engineers will also face several challenges and obstacles in adopting intelligent automation systems. New step-wise migration strategies are required to holistically support industries in their journey towards CPPS taking into account technical, economic and social aspects. This paper discusses the migration state-of-the-art strategies, analyzing them and providing a first attempt to define a migration approach for innovative production systems.},

Today, we are on the cusp of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In 2013, amongst one of 10 ‘Future Projects’ identified by the German government as part of its High-Tech Strategy 2020 Action Plan, the Industry 4.0 project is considered to be a major endeavour for Germany to establish itself as a leader of integrated industry. In 2014, China’s State Council unveiled their ten-year national plan, Made-in-China 2025, which was designed to transform China from the world’s workshop into a world manufacturing power. Made-in-China 2025 is an initiative to comprehensively upgrade China’s industry including the manufacturing sector. In Industry 4.0 and Made-in-China 2025, many applications require a combination of recently emerging new technologies, which is giving rise to the emergence of Industry 4.0. Such technologies originate from different disciplines including cyber-physical Systems, IoT, cloud computing, Industrial Integration, Enterprise Architecture, SOA, Business Process Management, Industrial Information Integration and others. At this present moment, the lack of powerful tools still poses a major obstacle for exploiting the full potential of Industry 4.0. In particular, formal methods and systems methods are crucial for realising Industry 4.0, which poses unique challenges. In this paper, we briefly survey the state of the art in the area of Industry 4.0 as it relates to industries.},

The IoT paradigm is changing the way people interact with things around them. It paves the way for creating pervasively connected infrastructures to support innovative services and promises better flexibility and efficiency. Such advantages are attractive not only for consumer applications, but also for the industrial domain. Over the last few years, we have been witnessing the IoT paradigm making its way into the industry marketplace with purposely designed solutions. In this paper, we clarify the concepts of IoT, Industrial IoT, and Industry 4.0. We highlight the opportunities brought in by this paradigm shift as well as the challenges for its realization. In particular, we focus on the challenges associated with the need of energy efficiency, real-time performance, coexistence, interoperability, and security and privacy.

One domain is an application in cyber-physical systems (CPSs), e.g., as a building block for the (Industrial) Internet of Things (IIoT) and Industry 4.0. In this regard, various use cases and designs have been proposed that seek to leverage the desirable properties blockchain technologies seem to offer. While many of the principles behind blockchain have actually been studied under the veil of Byzantine fault tolerance for decades, some approaches, such as relying on game-theoretic incentives and proof-of-work (PoW), are not yet fully understood. This knowledge gap can leave both practitioners and researchers in a difficult position regarding a possible application of such technologies, as it is often unclear what guarantees and characteristics a particular blockchain design actually achieves. This work-in-progress paper provides an overview of blockchain security research, outlines system designs that are likely to exhibit vulnerabilities, and provides examples of potentially insecure proposals in the field of CPSs that employ such designs.},

For instance, detecting early symptoms of cyber attacks may speed up the incident response process and mitigate consequences of attacks (e.g., business interruption, safety hazards). However, attaining a full understanding of the cyber situation may be challenging, given the complexity of CPSs and the ever-changing threat landscape. In particular, CPSs typically need to be continuously operational, may be sensitive to active scanning, and often provide only limited in-depth analysis capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose to utilize the concept of digital twins for enhancing cyber situational awareness. Digital twins, i.e., virtual replicas of systems, can run in parallel to their physical counterparts and allow deep inspection of their behavior without the risk of disrupting operational technology services. This paper reports our work in progress to develop a cyber situational awareness framework based on digital twins that provides a profound, holistic, and current view on the cyber situation that CPSs are in. More specifically, we present a prototype that provides real-time visualization features (i.e., system topology, program variables of devices) and enables a thorough, repeatable investigation process on a logic and network level. A brief explanation of technological use cases and outlook on future development efforts completes this work.},

  abstract  = {Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) may constitute an attractive attack target due to the increased networking of components that yields an expanded attack surface. If their physical control capabilities are compromised, safety implications may arise. Thus, it is vital that the CPSs being engineered are thoroughly tested and that adequate response measures can be realized upon detecting intruders during operation. However, security testing is hard to conduct due to expensive hardware, limited maintenance periods, and safety risks. Furthermore, the increased stealthiness of threat actors requires new intrusion detection and response methods. Interestingly, digital twins have become an important concept in industrial informatics to solve similar problems, yet with a non-security-related focus: Digital twins that virtually replicate the real systems provide cost-efficient modeling, testing, monitoring, and even predictive capabilities. However, until recently, the digital-twin concept has mainly focused on production optimizations or design improvements without considering its potential for CPS security. The Dagstuhl Seminar 22171 "Digital Twins for Cyber-Physical Systems Security" therefore aimed to serve as an interdisciplinary, open knowledge-sharing platform to investigate the benefits and challenges of applying the digital-twin concept to improve the security of CPSs.},

  abstract  = {Industrial control systems (ICSs), such as production systems or critical infrastructures, are an attractive target for cybercriminals, since attacks against these systems may cause severe physical damages/material damages (PD/MD), resulting in business interruption (BI) and loss of profit (LOP). Besides financial loss, cyber-attacks against ICSs can also harm human health or the environment or even be used as a kind of weapon. Thus, it is of utmost importance to manage cyber risks throughout the ICS’s lifecycle (i.e., engineering, operation, decommissioning), especially in light of the ever-increasing threat level that is accompanied by the progressive digitization of industrial processes. However, asset owners may not be able to address security risks sufficiently, nor adequately quantify them in terms of their potential impact (physical and non-physical) and likelihood. A self-deceptive solution might be using insurance to transfer these risks and offload them from their balance sheet since the underlying problem remains unsolved. The reason for this is that the exposure for asset owners remains and mitigation measures may still not be implemented adequately while the insurance industry is onboarding unassessed risks and covering it often without premium and without managing the potential exposure of accumulated events. The Dagstuhl Seminar 21451 "Managing Industrial Control Systems Security Risks for Cyber Insurance" aimed to provide an interdisciplinary forum to analyze and discuss open questions and current topics of research in this area in order to gain in-depth insights into the security risks of ICSs and the quantification thereof.},

Often, quality aspects are not considered when securing CPPSs, which creates attack vectors that could lead to malicious activity affecting the products' quality. Since quality control systems generally provide inadequate protection against intentionally introduced defects, and can be susceptible to attacks, quality considerations must be integrated into security-aware CPPS engineering. For this purpose, we propose the QualSec method that automatically identifies security risks pertaining to CPPSs, building on the quality characteristics associated with manufacturing operations to determine cascading effects. QualSec is based on a semantic representation of engineering knowledge, allowing to efficiently reuse engineering models from AutomationML artifacts. Moreover, QualSec utilizes Petri nets to facilitate the analysis of security risks and cascading effects. In this way, QualSec informs users about possible attack paths for compromising quality characteristics, how attackers may disguise their malicious actions, and the possible consequences of attacks with respect to product quality. We demonstrate the benefits of QualSec in a case study and analyze its scalability through a rigorous performance evaluation.},

However, conducting security risk assessments along the engineering process is a costly and labor-intensive endeavor due to the complexity of the system(s) under consideration and the lack of automated methods. This, in turn, hampers the ability of security analysts to assess risks pertaining to cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in an efficient manner. In this work, we propose a method that automatically identifies security risks based on the CPS's data representation, which exists within engineering artifacts. To lay the foundation for our method, we present security-focused semantics for the engineering data exchange format AutomationML (AML). These semantics enable the reuse of security-relevant know-how in AML artifacts by means of a formal knowledge representation, modeled with a security-enriched ontology. Our method is capable of automating the identification of security risk sources and potential consequences in order to construct cyber-physical attack graphs that capture the paths adversaries may take. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method through a case study and an open-source prototypical implementation. Finally, we prove that our solution is scalable by conducting a rigorous performance evaluation.},

  abstract  = {As the connectivity within manufacturing processes increases in light of Industry 4.0, information security becomes a pressing issue for product suppliers, systems integrators, and asset owners. Reaching new heights in digitizing the manufacturing industry also provides more targets for cyber attacks, hence, cyber-physical production systems (CPPSs) must be adequately secured to prevent malicious acts. To achieve a sufficient level of security, proper defense mechanisms must be integrated already early on in the systems' lifecycle and not just eventually in the operation phase. Although standardization efforts exist with the objective of guiding involved stakeholders toward the establishment of a holistic industrial security concept (e.g., IEC 62443), a dedicated security development lifecycle for systems integrators is missing. This represents a major challenge for engineers who lack sufficient information security knowledge, as they may not be able to identify security-related activities that can be performed along the production systems engineering (PSE) process. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology named Security Development Lifecycle for Cyber-Physical Production Systems (SDL-CPPS) that aims to foster security by design for CPPSs, i.e., the engineering of smart production systems with security in mind. More specifically, we derive security-related activities based on (i) security standards and guidelines, and (ii) relevant literature, leading to a security-improved PSE process that can be implemented by systems integrators. Furthermore, this paper informs domain experts on how they can conduct these security-enhancing activities and provides pointers to relevant works that may fill the potential knowledge gap. Finally, we review the proposed approach by means of discussions in a workshop setting with technical managers of an Austrian-based systems integrator to identify barriers to adopting the SDL-CPPS.},

  abstract = {Due to the gradual implementation of the Industry 4.0 vision, information technology is becoming increasingly important in industrial control systems (ICSs), such as production systems. Although the digital transformation of ICSs represents the foundation for resource-efficient and flexible industrial plants, this change increases the attack surface, leading to the emergence of new threats. Moreover, ICSs constitute an attractive target for attackers who may disrupt plant operation, causing severe physical/material damages (PD/MD), such as machinery breakdowns. In further consequence, asset owners (i.e., plant operators) may suffer from business interruption (BI) and loss of profit (LOP). Thus, security risks must be managed in all phases of the ICSs’ lifecycle, starting from engineering to decommissioning. Risk assessment is an integral part of the risk management process in which risks are identified, analyzed, and evaluated. In this context, the quantitative assessment is vital, since measuring cyber risks is required to establish an effective decision-making process for security investments. This survey article reviews the state of the art concerning quantitative security risk assessments for ICSs and identifies promising opportunities for future research and associated challenges. We report that the current state of quantitatively assessing cyber risks for ICSs is characterized by the absence of adequate (dynamic) security risk assessment methods tailored to the peculiarities of ICSs. This is aggravated by the fact that the complexity of the threat landscape increases in the light of Industry 4.0, and historical data on security incidents is lacking. As a consequence, asset owners may fail to quantitatively assess their cyber risk exposure, leaving them uncertain about security decisions. Furthermore, if they purchase cyber insurance in order to transfer the risks of non-PD BI, the underlying problem remains unsolved as (re)insurers potentially take on these unassessed risks. As an initial step to guide individuals seeking to improve the quantification of cyber risks pertaining to ICSs, this article concludes by outlining several directions for further research that are worth pursuing.},

  abstract  = {Digital twins refer to virtual replicas of physical objects that, inter alia, enable to monitor, visualize, and predict states of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). These capabilities yield efficiency gains and quality improvements in manufacturing processes. In addition, the concept of digital twins can also be leveraged to advance the security of the smart factory. More precisely, this concept can be applied as early as in the design phase by providing engineers the means to spot security flaws in the specification of the CPS. Security testing or intrusion detection are other security-enhancing technical use cases of digital twins that can be realized in systems engineering or during plant operation. In this chapter, we will discuss how digital twins can accompany their physical counterparts throughout the entire lifecycle and thereby strengthen the security of CPSs. The findings of this chapter indicate that the concept of digital twins will open up new paths to secure CPSs. However, efficiently creating, maintaining, and running digital twins still represents a major research challenge, as the overhead costs hinder the adoption of this concept. We believe that these insights are valuable to shape future research in this emerging research area at the intersection of digital twins and information security.},

  abstract = {The testing of automation applications has become a crucial pillar of every production systems engineering (PSE) project with the proliferation of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). In light of new attack vectors against CPSs, caused, inter alia, by increased connectivity, security aspects must be considered throughout the PSE process. In this context, software testing represents a critical activity, as a lack of adequate security mechanisms puts a variety of valuable assets (e.g., system configurations and production details) at risk of information theft and sabotage. Thus, organizations must analyze the security of their software testing process on a regular basis in order to counter these threats. Yet, due to the required security knowledge or budget constraints for security-related expenses, these undertakings may be destined to fail. In this work, we present a framework that supports the semi-automated security analysis of an organization’s software testing process for industrial automation software. This framework is based on the VDI/VDE 2182 guideline and integrates an ontological approach to model the necessary background knowledge, including, e.g., data flows, assets, entities, threats, and countermeasures. The framework comprises a default model of the testing process, which users can adapt so that the target of inspection accurately reflects their software testing environment. In particular, the testing process considered for creating the default model is based on best practices observed at a major system integrator, aligned with the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 series of software testing standards. Moreover, we developed a tool that enables the automatic generation of attack–defense trees from such formal models of the organization’s software testing process. We demonstrate how the proposed framework can be applied to a generic software testing process to answer essential questions in conducting a security risk analysis. The results of the exemplary security analysis provide guidance, should raise awareness in the industrial domain, and support effective, yet cost- and time-efficient security analyses. Finally, we evaluate the presented framework by performing a comprehensive comparison of suitable security analysis tools.},

  abstract = {Risk matrices—tables mapping “frequency” and “severity” ratings to corresponding risk priority levels—are popular in applications as diverse as terrorism risk analysis, highway construction project management, office building risk analysis, climate change risk management, and enterprise risk management (ERM). National and international standards (e.g., Military Standard 882C and AS/NZS 4360:1999) have stimulated adoption of risk matrices by many organizations and risk consultants. However, little research rigorously validates their performance in actually improving risk management decisions. This article examines some mathematical properties of risk matrices and shows that they have the following limitations. (a) Poor Resolution. Typical risk matrices can correctly and unambiguously compare only a small fraction (e.g., less than 10\%) of randomly selected pairs of hazards. They can assign identical ratings to quantitatively very different risks (“range compression”). (b) Errors. Risk matrices can mistakenly assign higher qualitative ratings to quantitatively smaller risks. For risks with negatively correlated frequencies and severities, they can be “worse than useless,” leading to worse-than-random decisions. (c) Suboptimal Resource Allocation. Effective allocation of resources to risk-reducing countermeasures cannot be based on the categories provided by risk matrices. (d) Ambiguous Inputs and Outputs. Categorizations of severity cannot be made objectively for uncertain consequences. Inputs to risk matrices (e.g., frequency and severity categorizations) and resulting outputs (i.e., risk ratings) require subjective interpretation, and different users may obtain opposite ratings of the same quantitative risks. These limitations suggest that risk matrices should be used with caution, and only with careful explanations of embedded judgments.},

  abstract = {Risk matrices are used during hazard identification and risk assessment processes and provide a construct for people needing to display the two variable relationship between likelihood and consequence that are considered to be the elements of risk. The purpose of a matrix is to reduce the continuum of risk into ranges or bands such as high, medium or low. These bands are often allocated colours such as red for the highest risks to green for the lowest. Sometimes each band in a matrix is allocated a numerical value or range. The multiplication of likelihood and consequence implies a quantitative basis although it may not be widely understood. The multiplication operator produces lines of equal risk that a matrix cannot model accurately and thereby introduces risk reversal errors. Weaknesses in matrices are further compounded by subjectivity and bias introduced by users and the value of such tools is brought into doubt. A shift of emphasis from the risk assessment stage to the risk control stage of a hazard management process may lead to better and more timely decision making and better use of resources.},

At the core of machine ethics is the handling of personal data and the security of machine operations. Yet, privacy and security engineering are a challenge in today's business world where personal data markets, corporate deadlines, and a lack of perfectionism frame the context in which engineers need to work. Besides these organizational and market challenges, each engineer has his or her specific view on the importance of these values that can foster or inhibit taking them into consideration. We present the results of an empirical study of 124 engineers based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and Jonas' Principle of Responsibility to understand the drivers and impediments of ethical system development as far as privacy and security engineering are concerned. We find that many engineers find the two values important, but do not enjoy working on them. We also find that many struggle with the organizational environment: They face a lack of time and autonomy that is necessary for building ethical systems, even at this basic level. Organizations' privacy and security norms are often too weak or even oppose value-based design, putting engineers in conflict with their organizations. Our data indicate that it is largely engineers' individually perceived responsibility as well as a few character traits that make a positive difference to ethical system development.},

This is due to the facts that plants grow in complexity and that modern automation systems are highly distributed and comprise complex components. To cope with these challenges and to guarantee short implementation times and a small number of errors for the automation systems, modern development processes are needed. Such modern processes can be reduced to four main aspects: (i) A seamless process with corresponding seamless tools, (ii) a high level of model reuse and adaptability, (iii) executable models and early tests, and (iv) a system-wide planing process of the distributed system. Therefore, the established tool landscape with its specialized tools for each discipline of engineering has difficulties to keep up with these trends. The approach presented in this paper implements a development process including the aspects (i) (iv) using the new data exchange format AutomationML.

Most technologists acknowledge this undertaking's importance, but they need some help in understanding how to tackle it. The article aims to provide that help by exploring software security best practices. A central and critical aspect of the computer security problem is a software problem. Software defects with security ramifications, including implementation bugs such as buffer overflows and design flaws such as inconsistent error handling, promise to be with us for years. All too often, malicious intruders can hack into systems by exploiting software defects. Internet-enabled software applications present the most common security risk encountered today, with software's ever-expanding complexity and extensibility adding further fuel to the fire. By any measure, security holes in software are common, and the problem is growing.},

  abstract  = {Within the last decade, Security became a major focus in the traditional IT-Industry, mainly through the interconnection of systems and especially through the connection to the Internet. This opened up a huge new attack surface, which resulted in major takedowns of legitimate services and new forms of crime and destruction. This led to the development of a multitude of new defense mechanisms and strategies, as well as the establishing of Security procedures on both, organizational and technical level. Production systems have mostly remained in isolation during these past years, with security typically focused on the perimeter. Now, with the introduction of new paradigms like Industry 4.0, this isolation is questioned heavily with Physical Production Systems (PPSs) now connected to an IT-world resulting in cyber-physical systems sharing the attack surface of traditional web based interfaces while featuring completely different goals, parameters like lifetime and safety, as well as construction. In this work, we present an outline on the major security challenges faced by cyber-physical production systems. While many of these challenges harken back to issues also present in traditional web based IT, we will thoroughly analyze the differences. Still, many new attack vectors appeared in the past, either in practical attacks like Stuxnet, or in theoretical work. These attack vectors use specific features or design elements of cyber-physical systems to their advantage and are unparalleled in traditional IT. Furthermore, many mitigation strategies prevalent in traditional IT systems are not applicable in the industrial world, e.g., patching, thus rendering traditional strategies in IT-Security unfeasible. A thorough discussion of the major challenges in CPPS-Security is thus required in order to focus research on the most important targets.},

We argue that this perceived benefit is probably illusory in most cases. We begin by describing a number of common scoring methods currently used to assess risk in a variety of different domains. We then review the literature on the use of ordinal scales in risk analysis, the use of “verbal scales” for eliciting estimates of risks and probabilities, and the extensive research about peculiar human errors when assessing risks. We also supplement this overview with some data of our own. When these diverse kinds of evidence are combined, the case against scoring methods is difficult to deny. In addition to the evidence against the value of scoring methods, there is also a lack of good evidence in their favor. We conclude our overview by reviewing the reasons why risk assessment approaches should describe risk in terms of mathematical probabilities.},

But do they improve decisions? This article compares the results of qualitative and quantitative risk assessment systems and establishes some theoretical limitations on the extent to which they are compatible. In general, qualitative risk rating systems satisfying conditions found in real-world rating systems and guidance documents and proposed as reasonable make two types of errors: (1) Reversed rankings, i.e., assigning higher qualitative risk ratings to situations that have lower quantitative risks; and (2) Uninformative ratings, e.g., frequently assigning the most severe qualitative risk label (such as “high”) to situations with arbitrarily small quantitative risks and assigning the same ratings to risks that differ by many orders of magnitude. Therefore, despite their appealing consensus-building properties, flexibility, and appearance of thoughtful process in input requirements, qualitative rating systems as currently proposed often do not provide sufficient information to discriminate accurately between quantitatively small and quantitatively large risks. The value of information (VOI) that they provide for improving risk management decisions can be zero if most risks are small but a few are large, since qualitative ratings may then be unable to confidently distinguish the large risks from the small. These limitations suggest that it is important to continue to develop and apply practical quantitative risk assessment methods, since qualitative ones are often unreliable.},

Unlike traditional information technology systems, cyber-physical systems are not limited to attacks aimed solely at intellectual property theft, but include attacks that maliciously affect the physical world. In manufacturing, cyber-physical attacks can destroy equipment, force dimensional product changes, or alter a product’s mechanical characteristics. The manufacturing industry often relies on modern quality control (QC) systems to protect against quality losses, such as those that can occur from an attack. However, cyber-physical attacks can still be designed to avoid detection by traditional QC methods, which suggests a strong need for new and more robust QC tools. As a first step toward the development of new QC tools, an attack taxonomy to better understand the relationships between QC systems, manufacturing systems, and cyber-physical attacks is proposed in this paper. The proposed taxonomy is developed from a quality control perspective and accounts for the attacker’s view point through considering four attack design consideration layers, each of which is required to successfully implement an attack. In addition, a detailed example of the proposed taxonomy layers being applied to a realistic production system is included in this paper.},

  abstract  = {With advances in computer and networking technologies, along with the increasing dependency on interconnected cyber-physical components, the threat of cyber-physical attacks against manufacturing is on the rise. As opposed to traditional cyber-attacks, cyber-physical attacks go beyond intellectual property theft and can affect the physical world. In manufacturing, such attacks can result in changed product designs, manipulated manufacturing equipment, and altered final products. For over a century, manufacturing systems have relied heavily on Quality Control (QC) systems to ensure stable processes and product integrity. However, previous research has suggested that current QC tools could be exploited by an adversary, making it difficult or even impossible to detect attacks. Unfortunately, there has been little to no effort to identify/understand opportunities where QC tools could be exploited, which is an essential step toward developing new cyber-security solutions for manufacturing. In response, this paper establishes a systematic approach to effectively categorize QC tool vulnerabilities. Furthermore, to highlight the importance of this research to the manufacturing community, the negative effects of exploiting QC tools by cyber-physical attacks are demonstrated in this paper. Finally, best practices and guidelines for better cyber-physical security in manufacturing are also presented.},

However, due to the increasing complexity of CPSs and more sophisticated attacks, conventional anomaly detection methods, which face the growing volume of data and need domain-specific knowledge, cannot be directly applied to address these challenges. To this end, deep learning-based anomaly detection (DLAD) methods have been proposed. In this article, we review state-of-the-art DLAD methods in CPSs. We propose a taxonomy in terms of the type of anomalies, strategies, implementation, and evaluation metrics to understand the essential properties of current methods. Further, we utilize this taxonomy to identify and highlight new characteristics and designs in each CPS domain. Also, we discuss the limitations and open problems of these methods. Moreover, to give users insights into choosing proper DLAD methods in practice, we experimentally explore the characteristics of typical neural models, the workflow of DLAD methods, and the running performance of DL models. Finally, we discuss the deficiencies of DL approaches, our findings, and possible directions to improve DLAD methods and motivate future research.},

To date, many DT applications have been successfully implemented in different industries, including product design, production, prognostics and health management, and some other fields. However, at present, no paper has focused on the review of DT applications in industry. In an effort to understand the development and application of DTs in industry, this paper thoroughly reviews the state-of-the-art of the DT research concerning the key components of DTs, the current development of DTs, and the major DT applications in industry.

  abstract  = {The design of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) poses a number of challenges, in particular for cyber-security. Eliciting Security Requirements is a key aspect in the early system design stages; however it is important to assess which requirements are more stringent and grant protection against the higher-value assets. Cyber-security Risk Assessment (SecRA) has a key role in determining threat scenarios and evaluating the risks associated to them but it is a practice that has been principally developed for IT systems, thus focusing on cyber threats. In this chapter, we discuss the state of the art in SecRA methodologies and the challenges to be addressed for developing new CPS-oriented SecRA methodologies. Based on the most relevant standards for industrial control systems and automotive domain (such as the ISA/IEC-62443 and the J3061), we propose the adoption of an asset-driven viewpoint and a model-based approach to SecRA, and we identify current gaps. In particular we discuss (i) CPS (security) modeling languages and methodologies, (ii) vulnerabilities cost models and the network of public repositories of vulnerabilities, (iii) attacker models and profiles, and (iv) complex cyber-physical attack chains. Finally, we discuss our vision, focusing on assets and leveraging model-based design practices can provide a more rigorous approach to SecRA for CPS, allow taking into consideration their peculiarities, and support to manage the large complexity involved in their operation. The desired outcome is to provide the system design team with methods and tools to identify complex attacks and perform a cost/benefit tradeoff analysis to justify the adoption of specific Security Requirements and the necessary costs implied by the corresponding mitigations.},

Far from an ideal solution, the involved engineering disciplines appear to work in parallel despite aiming for the same goal: securing the production systems. In this paper, we highlight small measures that are able to achieve large effects on CPPS security: (1) Extending interoperability testing by security testing gains robustness against intentionally malformed inputs; (2) the extension of today's models so that they enable the description of malicious actions would allow to assess system behavior in presence of an attack; and (3) a layered approach on CPPS security enables to address malicious activities at an adequate, semantic layer without the need for precarious shadow systems.},

The object of study is an artifact in context (Sect.{\thinspace}1.1), and its two major activities are designing and investigating this artifact in context (Sect.{\thinspace}1.2). For the design activity, it is important to know the social context of stakeholders and goals of the project, as this is the source of the research budget as well as the destination of useful research results. For the investigative activity, it is important to be familiar with the knowledge context of the project, as you will use this knowledge and also contribute to it. Jointly, the two major activities and the two contexts form a framework for design science that I describe in Sect.{\thinspace}1.3. In Sect.{\thinspace}1.4, I show why in design science the knowledge that we use and produce is not universal but has middle-range scope.},

Professional testing of software has become an increasingly important task that requires a profound knowledge of testing techniques. The ISTQB has developed a universally accepted, international qualification scheme aimed at software and system testing professionals, and has created the syllabi and the tests for the "Certified Tester." With authors who are among the founders of the Certified Tester Syllabus, this thoroughly revised and updated 3rd Edition covers the "Foundations Level" (i.e., entry level) and teaches the most important methods of software testing. It is designed for self-study and provides the knowledge necessary to pass the Certified Tester: Foundations Level exam as defined by the ISTQB. Additionally, in this new edition, technical terms have been stated more precisely according to the revised and uptated ISTQB glossary.},

In practice, the test automation tool chain cannot be fully automated because of missing links between different tools used in the test automation process. Closing these gaps typically require (high) human effort. Furthermore, domain and software testing expertise is often bundled by one (expensive) engineer who is responsible for the application domain (reflected in use cases and test cases) and software tests (software test code). This paper presents a flexible Testing Automation Framework (TAF) that enables the configuration of test processes involving different tools and various layers for test automation and enables separated roles for the application domain and software tests. We build on best-practice test automation from Software Engineering and design a test automation process for the automation systems domain. We demonstrate the feasibility with a use case, derived from production systems automation, with selected tools covering all test automation layers. First results showed the feasibility of the framework in the evaluation use case making test processes more flexible and automated. Although the successful implementation of the TAF can support the efficient configuration and execution of test processes, there is additional effort for preparing the flexible and automated tool chain.},

  abstract  = {Critical infrastructures and industrial control systems are complex Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). To ensure reliable operations of such systems, comprehensive threat modeling during system design and validation is of paramount significance. Previous works in literature mostly focus on safety, risks and hazards in CPS but lack effective threat modeling necessary to eliminate cyber vulnerabilities. Further, impact of cyber attacks on physical processes is not fully understood. This paper presents a comprehensive threat modeling framework for CPS using STRIDE, a systematic approach for ensuring system security at the component level. This paper first devises a feasible and effective methodology for applying STRIDE and then demonstrates it against a real synchrophasor-based synchronous islanding testbed in the laboratory. It investigates (i) what threat types could emerge in each system component based on the security properties lacking, and (ii) how a vulnerability in a system component risks the entire system security. The paper identifies that STRIDE is a light-weight and effective threat modeling methodology for CPS that simplifies the task for security analysts to identify vulnerabilities and plan appropriate component level security measures at the system design stage.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an approach enabling economic modelling of information security risk management in contemporaneous businesses and other organizations. In the world of permanent cyber attacks to ICT systems, risk management is becoming a crucial task for minimization of the potential risks that can endeavor their operation. The prevention of the heavy losses that may happen due to cyber attacks and other information system failures in an organization is usually associated with continuous investment in different security measures and purchase of data protection systems. With the rise of the potential risks the investment in security services and data protection is growing and is becoming a serious economic issue to many organizations and enterprises. This paper analyzes several approaches enabling assessment of the necessary investment in security technology from the economic point of view. The paper introduces methods for identification of the assets, the threats, the vulnerabilities of the ICT systems and proposes a procedure that enables selection of the optimal investment of the necessary security technology based on the quantification of the values of the protected systems. The possibility of using the approach for an external insurance based on the quantified risk analyses is also provided.},

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty—and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition—in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information.
Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability.},

Forms for recording tool selection criteria, classifying testing tools, profiling tool-to-organization interconnections, creating hardware and software profiles, and creating tool-interconnection profiles are presented.

In contrast to business administration processes, engineering processes are highly specific and can include various heterogeneous engineering tools to be integrated in an overall process and project environment. [Challenge] High complexity and volatility of engineering processes require specific solutions to define, model, implement, and evaluate individual engineering process steps. In this paper we focus on the first step of process management, i.e., The process definition phase. Based on the well-established Business Process Management Notation (BPMN) various tools have been developed that aim at supporting process modeling and automation. The key question is to what extent different tools support process automation in a defined context, i.e., In heterogeneous engineering environments. [Method] Following a common tool evaluation approach, we developed an evaluation framework and conducted a feasibility study to investigate process modeling and automation capability of tools based on defined requirements and scenarios. [Results] The developed tool evaluation process was found useful for analyzing candidate process modeling tools. In addition, results of the evaluation process highlighted a set of specific tools that can support modeling and process automation. [Conclusions] The evaluation framework can enable benchmarking for process modeling tools and support (a) process engineers in selecting most valuable tools and (b) tool vendors to better understand complex process needs with respect to improving and/or extending current solutions.},

In this context, a tool to perform systematic analysis of threat modeling for CPS is proposed. A real-world wireless railway temperature monitoring system is used as a case study to validate the proposed approach.

  abstract  = {Industrial control systems are an important part of critical infrastructures and their uninterrupted operation is important for many aspects of society. In recent years these systems have come under more scrutiny, as reports about attacks on them have become more frequent. There is therefore a need to better secure them, and the first step to achieve this is to identify the threat landscape for such systems. This is typically done by creating a threat model of a system, enumerating the potential threats, and then devising mitigation options based on the discovered threats. However, many of the available threat modeling methods and tools target very specific systems (e.g., software components), and do not lend themselves well to evaluating diverse systems or abstract reference architectures of systems. In this paper we present a methodology for system threat modeling that addresses this gap, by enabling the modeling of a diverse range of systems and reference architectures of systems. Furthermore, the methodology provides additional functionality, such as guiding the user in the completion of a threat model and automatically detecting unmitigated threats in a system. In addition, our methodology also takes mitigation into account by modeling the security components in a system. We have implemented the methodology in a web-based tool, and also evaluated the tool on a reference architecture of a complex automation system, validating both the approach and the tool.},

Where security has been a consideration, there has been no clear methodology to assess the security risks in the protocol specification. This paper describes the application of the attack tree methodology to SCADA communication systems based on the common MODBUS protocol stack. The authors identify eleven possible attacker goals and identify security vulnerabilities inherent in both the specification and in typical deployments of SCADA systems. These are then used to suggest possible best practices for SCADA operators and improvement to the MODBUS standard.},

The measure of vulnerabilities in the power system control framework is determined based on existing cybersecurity conditions before the vulnerability indices are evaluated. After the indices are evaluated, an upper bound is imposed on each scenario vulnerability in order to determine the pivotal attack leaves that require countermeasure improvements.

It is being widely used in areas closely related to national economy and people's livelihood, therefore CPS security problems have drawn a global attention and an appropriate risk assessment for CPS is in urgent need. Existing risk assessment for CPS always focuses on the reliability assessment, using Probability Risk Assessment (PRA). In this way, the assessment of physical part and cyber part is isolated as PRA is difficult to quantify the risks from the cyber world. Methodologies should be developed to assess the both parts as a whole system, considering this integrated system has a high coupling between the physical layer and cyber layer. In this paper, a risk assessment idea for CPS with the use of attack tree is proposed. Firstly, it presents a detailed description about the threat and vulnerability attributes of each leaf in an attack tree and tells how to assign value to its threat and vulnerability vector. Then this paper focuses on calculating the threat and vulnerability vector of an attack path with the use of the leaf vector values. Finally, damage is taken into account and an idea to calculate the risk value of the whole attack path is given.},

The manual construction of such objects relies on the creativity and experience of specialists, and therefore it is error-prone and impracticable for large systems. Nonetheless, the automated generation of attack trees has only been explored in connection to computer networks and levering rich models, whose analysis typically leads to an exponential blow-up of the state space. We propose a static analysis approach where attack trees are automatically inferred from a process algebraic specification in a syntax-directed fashion, encompassing a great many application domains and avoiding incurring systematically an exponential explosion. Moreover, we show how the standard propositional denotation of an attack tree can be used to phrase interesting quantitative problems, that can be solved through an encoding into Satisfiability Modulo Theories. The flexibility and effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on the study of a national-scale authentication system, whose attack tree is computed thanks to a Java implementation of the framework.},

  abstract  = {Security risk management can be applied on well-defined or existing systems; in this case, the objective is to identify existing vulnerabilities, assess the risks and provide for the adequate countermeasures. Security risk management can also be applied very early in the system's development life-cycle, when its architecture is still poorly defined; in this case, the objective is to positively influence the design work so as to produce a secure architecture from the start. The latter work is made difficult by the uncertainties on the architecture and the multiple round-trips required to keep the risk assessment study and the system architecture aligned. This is particularly true for very large projects running over many years. This paper addresses the issues raised by those risk assessment studies performed early in the system's development life-cycle. Based on industrial experience, it asserts that attack trees can help solve the human cognitive scalability issue related to securing those large, continuously-changing system-designs. However, big attack trees are difficult to build, and even more difficult to maintain. This paper therefore proposes a systematic approach to automate the construction and maintenance of such big attack trees, based on the system's operational and logical architectures, the system's traditional risk assessment study and a security knowledge database.},

Formalisation of human behaviour is difficult at best, and attacks on socio-technical systems are still mostly identified through brainstorming of experts. In this work we formalize attack tree generation including human factors; based on recent advances in system models we develop a technique to identify possible attacks analytically, including technical and human factors. Our systematic attack generation is based on invalidating policies in the system model by identifying possible sequences of actions that lead to an attack. The generated attacks are precise enough to illustrate the threat, and they are general enough to hide the details of individual steps.},

The security metrics need to provide insight on weak points in the system defense, considering characteristics of both the system and its adversaries. To provide such metrics, we formally define the ADversary View Security Evaluation (ADVISE) method. Our approach is to create an executable state-based security model of a system and an adversary that represents how the adversary is likely to attack the system and the results of such an attack. The attack decision function uses information about adversary attack preferences and possible attacks against the system to mimic how the adversary selects the most attractive next attack step. The adversary's decision involves looking ahead some number of attack steps. System architects can use ADVISE to compare the security strength of system architecture variants and analyze the threats posed by different adversaries. We demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of ADVISE using a case study. To produce quantitative model-based security metrics, we have implemented the ADVISE method in a tool that facilitates user input of system and adversary data and automatically generates executable models.},

Lately, these systems have become a popular target for cyber attacks. Both during their design and while operational, security is often an afterthought, leaving them vulnerable to all sorts of attacks.

This paper presents a formal approach for analysing the security of Industrial Control Systems. A knowledge-based system, namely IDP, is used to analyse a model of the control system and extract system vulnerabilities. In this paper we present the input model of the methodology and the inferences and queries that allow the system to extract vulnerabilities. This methodology has been added to an existing framework where the user can model his system in the modeling language SysML. This SysML model then gets parsed into suitable IDP input. A fully working prototype has been developed and the approach has been validated on a real case study.},

Building software systems that are resistant to these threats is one of the greatest challenges in information technology. Threat identification methods for secure software development can be found in the literature. However, none of these methods has involved automatic threat identification based on analyzing UML models. Such an automated approach should offer benefits in terms of speed and accuracy when compared to manual methods, and at the same time be widely applicable due to the ubiquity of UML. This paper addresses this shortcoming by proposing an automated threat identification method based on parsing UML diagrams.},

Our technique decouples the creation of a system's architecture from the process of detecting and collecting architectural flaws. This way, our approach allows an software architect to automatically detect vulnerabilities in software architectures by using a security knowledge base. We evaluated our approach with real-world case studies, focusing on logistics applications. The evaluation uncovered several flaws with a major impact on the security of the software.},

  abstract  = {Assessing security of software services on Cloud is complex because the security depends on the vulnerability of infrastructure, platform and the software services. In many systems, the platform or the infrastructure on which the software will actually run may not be known or guaranteed. This implies that the security of the software service must be assured regardless of the underlying infrastructure or platform, requiring a large number of combinations. Another common trend in Cloud and Service oriented Architecture (SoA) environments is Service composition, whereby new services can be created rapidly by composing existing services. Once again, the component services must be tested for security levels on a large number of platform and infrastructure combinations. In this paper we propose a novel vulnerability assessment framework for cloud computing systems. We have designed and developed a prototype of our framework. We also present the design and development of our framework with some use cases.},

Which countermeasures thwart buffer overflow attacks? At the moment, the ontology comprises 88 threat classes, 79 asset classes, 133 countermeasure classes and 34 relations between those classes.

The ultimate challenge in many organizations is to assess their risk factors for their computers and networks. There is no way to completely overcome the threat that an organization might have. The goal is to calculate risks, so that problems resulting from them could be minimized and to fill the gap between business entities (like a project, a role) and organization infrastructure using semantic Web technologies.

  abstract  = {Compared to the last decades, we have recently seen more and more governmental applications which are provided via the Internet directly to the citizens. Due to the long history of IT systems in the governmental sector and the connection of these legacy systems to newer technologies, most governmental institutions are faced with a heterogeneous IT environment. More and more governmental duties and responsibilities rely solely on IT systems which have to be highly dependable to ensure the proper operation of these governmental services. An increasing amount of software vulnerabilities and the generally heightened physical threat level due to terror attacks and natural disasters demand for a holistic IT security approach which captures, manages, and secures the entire governmental IT infrastructure. Our contribution is (1) a novel inventory solution, (2) a mechanism to embed the virtual IT infrastructure data into a physical model provided by our security ontology, and (3) a methodology to automatically identify threatened assets and to reason on the current security status based on formal threat definitions taking software configurations and physical locations into account. A prototypical implementation of the aforementioned concepts shows how these concepts help governmental institutions to secure their IT infrastructure in a holistic and systematic way to fortify their IT systems in an appropriate way against current and future threats.},

Rather than following a purely technical approach, we bring in a social and behavioral perspective through a combination of conceptual security knowledge modeling, behavioral modeling of threat agents, simulation of attacks, and evolutionary optimization. Based on results from numerous attack simulations for various internal and external attackers, metrics such as impact on confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the simulated attacks are monitored and efficient sets of security controls with respect to multiple risk, cost and benefit objectives are determined. We describe the developed approach as well as a prototypical implementation and demonstrate its applicability by means of an illustrative example.},

  abstract  = {Security assurance is a rapidly evolving but well understood discipline in the software industry. Many firms have adopted the Security Development Lifecycle as a process to identify and fix vulnerabilities in their products before they are released. To do this, they rely on sound software security practices, tools and precise technical information available through a vast collection of publicly known vulnerabilities and exploits. Historically, secure development practices for hardware products have not developed as fast. Only a limited number of methodologies, standards, exploits, and testing tools exist to assist vendors with their security assurance goals. This paper presents a Hardware Security Development Lifecycle at the hardware technology level that has been used on commercial CPUs, chipsets, and SoCs. It describes how a structured flow of analysis and testing activities organized in five phases can accelerate the discovery of security issues in computer hardware products that could be exploited through software or physical attacks. We summarize lessons learned over several years of security evaluation experience that have resulted in a systematic method that can be adapted to make security assurance an integral part of hardware development cycles.},

This paper proposes a combined safety and security development lifecycle. We review existing standards in order to identify safety and security core activities. Based on the results, a combined lifecycle is introduced that integrates both safety and security considerations and activities in a coordinated way. Finally the feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by case studies.},

Integrating security-related activities into the early phases of the development life cycle is a monolithic and cost-effective solution for the development of security-critical cyber-physical systems. These activities often incorporate security mechanisms from different realms. We present a fine-grained design flow paradigm for security-critical and software-intensive cyber-physical systems. We provide a comprehensive survey on the domain-specific architectures, countermeasure techniques and security standards involved in the development life cycle of security-critical cyber-physical systems, and adapt these elements to the newly designed flow paradigm. Finally, we provide prospectives and future directions for improving the usability and security level of this design flow paradigm.},

The complexity of such production systems has significantly been increased in the last years, (Koren et al., CIRP Ann Manuf Technol 48(2):527--540, 1999). This increase was a result of the increased complexity and variance of products. As a result of this, the engineering workflow of automated production system has continuously been adapted to new requirements. In this regards, this chapter shows and describes the current engineering workflow of automated production systems based on experience in the field of production system for the automotive industry. The main focus of this description is set on the established tool-chains and used tools to create engineering information as well as data formats to save and exchange information between tools and involved personnel. In the introduction of this chapter, differences between an automated production system and a cyber-physical system are given. Current production systems could be named CPPS but this term is not popular in the field of production system builder as well as production owners. But in spite of that the end of this chapter gives an outlook of the future of automated production systems in direction of CPPS.},

Power fingerprinting, which uses physical measurements from a side channel such as power consumption or electromagnetic emissions, is a promising new technique for detecting malicious software execution in critical systems. The technique can be used to directly monitor the execution of systems with constrained resources without the need to load third-party software artifacts on the platforms.},

However, the ease of distributing and connecting related control systems for the purposes of increasing performance has resulted in interdependencies that can lead to unexpected conditions. Even with less complex designs, operators and engineers alike are often left with competing goals that are difficult to resolve. A fundamental reason for this dichotomy is that responsibilities lie with different disciplines, and operations are hosted on separate control systems. In addition, with the rising awareness of cyber security and diverse human interactions with control systems, an understanding of human actions from a malicious and benevolent standpoint is necessary. Resilience considers the multiple facets of requirements that drive the performance of control systems in a holistic fashion, whether they are security or stability, stability or efficiency, human interactions or complex interdependencies. As will be shown by example, current research philosophies lack the depth or the focus on the control system application to satisfy these requirements, such as graceful degradation of hierarchical control while under cyber attack. A resilient control system promises to purposefully consider these diverse requirements, developing an adaptive capacity to complex events that can lead to failure of traditional control system designs.},

  abstract  = {The vast majority of today's critical infrastructure is supported by numerous feedback control loops and an attack on these control loops can have disastrous consequences. This is a major concern since modern control systems are becoming large and decentralized and thus more vulnerable to attacks. This paper is concerned with the estimation and control of linear systems when some of the sensors or actuators are corrupted by an attacker. We give a new simple characterization of the maximum number of attacks that can be detected and corrected as a function of the pair (A,C) of the system and we show in particular that it is impossible to accurately reconstruct the state of a system if more than half the sensors are attacked. In addition, we show how the design of a secure local control loop can improve the resilience of the system. When the number of attacks is smaller than a threshold, we propose an efficient algorithm inspired from techniques in compressed sensing to estimate the state of the plant despite attacks. We give a theoretical characterization of the performance of this algorithm and we show on numerical simulations that the method is promising and allows to reconstruct the state accurately despite attacks. Finally, we consider the problem of designing output-feedback controllers that stabilize the system despite sensor attacks. We show that a principle of separation between estimation and control holds and that the design of resilient output feedback controllers can be reduced to the design of resilient state estimators.},

A little focus is given to attacks on physical components. In this paper a method to detect potential attacks on physical components in a Cyber Physical System (CPS) is proposed. Physical attacks are detected through a comparison of noise pattern from sensor measurements to a reference noise pattern. If an adversary has physically modified or replaced a sensor, the proposed method issues an alert indicating that a sensor is probably compromised or is defective. A reference noise pattern is established from the sensor data using a deterministic model. This pattern is referred to as a fingerprint of the corresponding sensor. The fingerprint so derived is used as a reference to identify measured data during the operation of a CPS. Extensive experimentation with ultrasonic level sensors in a realistic water treatment testbed point to the effectiveness of the proposed fingerprinting method in detecting physical attacks.},

  abstract  = {Cyberphysical systems (CPSs) refer to the embedding of widespread sensing, networking, computation, and control into physical spaces with the goal of making them safer, more efficient, and reliable. Driven by the miniaturization and integration of sensing, communication, and computation in cost-efficient devices, CPSs are bound to transform industries such as aerospace, transportation, built environments, energy, health care, and manufacturing, to name a few. This great opportunity, unfortunately, is matched by even greater challenges. Taming the complexity of design and analysis of these systems poses a fundamental problem as a new paradigm is needed to bridge various scientific domains, which, through the years, have developed significantly different formalisms and methodologies. In addition, while the use of dedicated communication networks has so far sheltered systems from the outside world, use of off-the-shelf networking and computing, combined with the unattended operation of a plethora of devices, provides several opportunities for malicious entities to inject attacks on CPSs. A wide variety of motivations exists for launching an attack on CPSs, ranging from economic reasons, such as obtaining a financial gain, all the way to terrorism, for instance, threatening an entire population by manipulating life-critical resources. Any attack on safety-critical CPSs may significantly hamper the economy and lead to the loss of human lives. While the threat of attacks on CPSs tends to be underplayed at times, the Stuxnet worm provided a clear example of the possible future to come. This malware, targeting a uranium enriching facility in Iran, managed to reach the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system controlling the centrifuges used in the enrichment process. Stuxnet modified the control system, increasing pressure in the centrifuges in a first version of the worm and spinning centrifuges in an erratic fashion in a second version. As a result, Stuxnet caused significant damage to the plant [1]. For details, see "The Stuxnet Attack".},

Applications range from chemical processes and water treatment facilities to oil and gas production and electric power generation and distribution. Current research on SCADA system security focuses on the primary SCADA components and targets network centric attacks. Security risks via attacks against the peripheral devices such as the Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) have not been sufficiently addressed. Our research results address the need to develop PLC applications that are correct, safe and secure. This research provides an analysis of software safety and security threats. We develop countermeasures that are compatible with the existing PLC technologies. We study both intentional and unintentional software errors and propose methods to prevent them. The main contributions of this dissertation are: 1). Develop a taxonomy of software errors and attacks in ladder logic 2). Model ladder logic vulnerabilities 3). Develop security design patterns to avoid software vulnerabilities and incorrect practices 4). Implement a proof of concept static analysis tool which detects the vulnerabilities in the PLC code and recommend corresponding design patterns.},

In contrast, risk assessment in most other industry sectors aims at deriving quantitative risk estimations (e.g., Basel II in Finance). This article presents a model and methodology to leverage on the large amount of data available from the IT infrastructure of an organization's security operation center to quantitatively estimate the probability of attack. Our methodology specifically addresses untargeted attacks delivered by automatic tools that make up the vast majority of attacks in the wild against users and organizations. We consider two-stage attacks whereby the attacker first breaches an Internet-facing system, and then escalates the attack to internal systems by exploiting local vulnerabilities in the target. Our methodology factors in the power of the attacker as the number of “weaponized” vulnerabilities he/she can exploit, and can be adjusted to match the risk appetite of the organization. We illustrate our methodology by using data from a large financial institution, and discuss the significant mismatch between traditional qualitative risk assessments and our quantitative approach.},

The ADVISE formalism has been implemented as a Möbius atomic model formalism in order to leverage the existing set of mature modeling formalisms and solution techniques offered by Möbius. This tool paper explains the ADVISE implementation in Möbius and provides technical details for Möbius users who want to use ADVISE either alone or in combination with other modeling formalisms provided by Möbius.},

It entail far-reaching consequences for connected embedded or cyber-physical systems, including physical harm. Security experts focus either on finding out and deriving security mechanisms from more or less explicitly defined security requirements or on the a posteriori assessment of vulnerabilities, namely pentesting. These approaches however often miss the necessary iterations between security countermeasures and system functionalities in terms of design and deployment. Worse, they generally fail to consider the implications of security issues over the system's safety, like for instance the adverse effect that security countermeasures may produce over expected deadlines due to costly computations and communications latencies. SysML-Sec focuses on these issues throughout design and development thanks to its model-driven approach that promotes exchanges between system architects, safety engineers, and security experts. This paper discusses how SysML-Sec can be used to simultaneously deal with safety and security requirements, and illustrates the methodology with an automotive use case.},

This paper introduces a simulation-based model to assess the repercussions on manufacturing systems’ performance under the potential presence of cyber-threats. The applicability of the assessment model has been validated through the implementation of a case study for the manufacturing sector. Different scenarios have been developed in order to apply an experimental design analysis, where several factors on the model will permit to elucidate the combination of controllable defense policies and uncontrollable security-based parameters that will reduce the negative impact on the manufacturing system’s performance. Results have revealed that the impact of cyber-attacks on manufacturing physical operations can be reduced by different defense policies such as increasing capacity of resources at the shop floor and applying more conservative reorder policies for certain situations. Levels among recovery times did not yield the same magnitude of effect. As far as the uncontrollable factors for companies are concerned, it was revealed that the mean time between attacks and the number of potential threat sources have a significant influence on the performance metrics of the system.},

Among these systems, industrial control systems (ICS) operating on critical infrastructures have been proven to be an attractive target for attackers. The case of Stuxnet has not only showed that ICSs are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, but also that some of these attacks rely on understanding the processes beyond the employed systems and using such knowledge to maximize the damage. This concept is commonly known as "semantic attack". Our paper discusses a specific type of semantic attack involving "sequences of events". Common network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) generally search for single, unusual or "not permitted" operations. In our case, rather than a malicious event, we show how a specific series of "permitted" operations can elude standard intrusion detection systems and still damage an infrastructure. Moreover, we present a possible approach to the development of a sequence-aware intrusion detection system (S-IDS). We propose a S-IDS reference architecture and we discuss all the steps through its implementations. Finally, we test the S-IDS on real ICS traffic samples captured from a water treatment and purification facility.},

By complex attack, we mean attacks composed of a set of commands that, while licit when considered in isolation on a single-packet basis, can disrupt the correct behavior of the system when executed in particular operating states. The proposed IDS detects these complex attacks thanks to an internal representation of the controlled SCADA system. We also present the corresponding rule language powerful enough to express the system's critical states. Furthermore, we present a prototype of the proposed IDS, able to monitor systems using the ModBus and DNP3 communication protocols.},

SCADA systems have evolved into large and complex networks of information systems and are increasingly vulnerable to various types of cyber-security risks. Identifying and managing risks in SCADA systems has become critical in ensuring the safety and reliability of these facilities and infrastructures. Most of the existing research on SCADA risk modeling and management has focused on probability-based or quantitative approaches. While probabilistic approaches have proven to be useful, they also suffer from common problems such as simplifying assumptions, large implementation costs, and inability to completely capture all the important aspects of risk. This paper proposes a digraph model for SCADA systems that allows formal, explicit representation of a SCADA system. A number of risk management methods are presented and discussed for a SCADA system based on the proposed model. The methods are applied to a chemical distillation application as a case study, and shows promising initial results in identifying areas of system vulnerability.},

  abstract  = {Modern processors use branch prediction and speculative execution to maximize performance. For example, if the destination of a branch depends on a memory value that is in the process of being read, CPUs will try to guess the destination and attempt to execute ahead. When the memory value finally arrives, the CPU either discards or commits the speculative computation. Speculative logic is unfaithful in how it executes, can access the victim's memory and registers, and can perform operations with measurable side effects. Spectre attacks involve inducing a victim to speculatively perform operations that would not occur during correct program execution and which leak the victim's confidential information via a side channel to the adversary. This paper describes practical attacks that combine methodology from side channel attacks, fault attacks, and return-oriented programming that can read arbitrary memory from the victim's process. More broadly, the paper shows that speculative execution implementations violate the security assumptions underpinning numerous software security mechanisms, including operating system process separation, containerization, just-in-time (JIT) compilation, and countermeasures to cache timing and side-channel attacks. These attacks represent a serious threat to actual systems since vulnerable speculative execution capabilities are found in microprocessors from Intel, AMD, and ARM that are used in billions of devices. While makeshift processor-specific countermeasures are possible in some cases, sound solutions will require fixes to processor designs as well as updates to instruction set architectures (ISAs) to give hardware architects and software developers a common understanding as to what computation state CPU implementations are (and are not) permitted to leak.},

  abstract = {This paper describes an approach for developing threat models for attacks on control systems. These models are useful for analyzing the actions taken by an attacker who gains access to control system assets and for evaluating the effects of the attacker’s actions on the physical process being controlled. The paper proposes models for integrity attacks and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and evaluates the physical and economic consequences of the attacks on a chemical reactor system. The analysis reveals two important points. First, a DoS attack does not have a significant effect when the reactor is in the steady state; however, combining the DoS attack with a relatively innocuous integrity attack rapidly causes the reactor to move to an unsafe state. Second, an attack that seeks to increase the operational cost of the chemical reactor involves a radically different strategy than an attack on plant safety (i.e., one that seeks to shut down the reactor or cause an explosion).},

Cyber-attacks to SCADA networks may cause equipment damage or even fatalities. Identifying risks in SCADA networks is critical to ensuring the normal operation of these industrial systems. In this paper we propose a Bayesian network-based cyber-security risk assessment model to dynamically and quantitatively assess the security risk level in SCADA networks. The major distinction of our work is that the proposed risk assessment method can learn model parameters from historical data and then improve assessment accuracy by incrementally learning from online observations. Furthermore, our method is able to assess the risk caused by unknown attacks. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective for SCADA security risk assessment.},

However, they face various cyberattacks, which may cause physical damage to these industrial facilities. Therefore, ensuring the security of ICPSs is of paramount importance. For this purpose, a new risk assessment method is presented in this paper to quantify the impact of cyberattacks on the physical system of ICPSs. This method helps carry out appropriate attack mitigation measures. The method uses a Bayesian network to model the attack propagation process and infers the probabilities of sensors and actuators to be compromised. These probabilities are fed into a stochastic hybrid system (SHS) model to predict the evolution of the physical process being controlled. Then, the security risk is quantified by evaluating the system availability with the SHS model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with a case study on a hardware-in-the-loop simulation test bed.},

After defining the value of information assets to their organization with regards to confidentiality, integrity and availability breaches, pwnPr3d allows users to automatically quantify information security risk over time, depending on the possible progression of the attacker.

Bringing together safety and security work is becoming imperative, as a connected safety-critical system is not safe if it is not secure. The main objective of this study is to investigate the current status of safety and security co-analysis in system engineering by conducting a systematic literature review. The steps of the review are the following: the research questions identification; agreement upon a search string; applying the search string to chosen databases; a selection criterion formulation for the relevant publications filtering; selected papers categorization and analysis. We focused on the early system development stages and identified 33 relevant publications categorized as follows: combined safety and security approaches that consider the mutual influence of safety and security; safety-informed security approaches that consider influence of safety on security; and security-informed safety approaches that consider influence of security on safety. The results showed that a number of identified approaches are driven by needs in fast developing application areas, e.g., automotive, while works focusing on combined analysis are mostly application area independent. Overall, the study shows that safety and security co-analysis is still a developing domain.},

To address this challenge, this paper proposes a new method for assessing the direct and indirect impacts of attacks on cyber–physical systems (CPSs). The proposed method studies the dynamic behavior of systems in normal situation and under security attacks and evaluates the consequence propagation of attacks. The inputs to the model are control parameters including sensor readings and controller signals. The output of the model is evaluating the consequence propagation of attacks, ranking the important assets of systems based on their sensitivity to conducted attacks, and prioritizing the attacks based on their impacts on the behavior of system. The validation phase of the proposed method is performed by modeling and evaluating the consequence propagation of attacks against a boiling water power plant (BWPP).},

Furthermore, recent cyber-attacks on various organisations prove that the technical controls, security policies, and regulatory compliance are not sufficient to mitigate the cyber risks. In such a scenario, the residual cyber risk can be mitigated with cyber-insurance policies and with information security derivatives (financial instruments). Information security derivatives are a new class of financial instruments designed to provide an alternate risk mitigation mechanism to reduce the potential adverse impact of an information security event. However, there is a lack of research on the metrics to measure the performance of information security derivatives in mitigating the underlying risk. This article examines the basic requirements to assess the performance of information security derivatives. Furthermore, the article presents three metrics, namely hedge ratio, hedge effectiveness, and hedge efficiency to formulate and evaluate a cyber risk mitigation strategy devised with information security derivatives. Also, the application of these metrics is demonstrated in an imaginary scenario. The accurate measure of performance of information security derivatives is of practical importance for effective risk management strategy.},

Risk assessment is a key component in security protection process, but existing methods of risk assessment generally lack the capacity of quantification and the adaptability to the dynamic evolution of ICS. In this paper, we discuss a model-data integrated risk assessment method. In the proposed method, Bayesian network model is applied to achieve quantitative risk assessment, and the model is optimized dynamically using an online data-driven parameter learning strategy, which can improve the accuracy of real-time dynamic assessment result. The effectiveness of proposed method is demonstrated with a case study on a simulated process control system.},

We propose to take advantage of their capabilities to go beyond the traditional techniques used to model attack scenarios.

Attack trees are inherently static and limited to independent events, whereas BDMP are dynamic and can take into account simple dependences. This allows the modeling of attack sequences, but also of defensive aspects such as detections. Petri net-based approaches are highly flexible but often lack readability and scalability; BDMP representations are close to attack trees, inheriting their readability and easy appropriation. Moreover, BDMP have mathematical properties leading to drastic reductions of combinatorial problems, allowing efficient scenarios processing and time dependent quantifications. Finally, limits and improvement perspectives are discussed.},

  abstract = {Security risk assessment and mitigation are two vital processes that need to be executed to maintain a productive IT infrastructure. On one hand, models such as attack graphs and attack trees have been proposed to assess the cause-consequence relationships between various network states, while on the other hand, different decision problems have been explored to identify the minimum-cost hardening measures. However, these risk models do not help reason about the causal dependencies between network states. Further, the optimization formulations ignore the issue of resource availability while analyzing a risk model. In this paper, we propose a risk management framework using Bayesian networks that enable a system administrator to quantify the chances of network compromise at various levels. We show how to use this information to develop a security mitigation and management plan. In contrast to other similar models, this risk model lends itself to dynamic analysis during the deployed phase of the network. A multiobjective optimization platform provides the administrator with all trade-off information required to make decisions in a resource constrained environment.},

However, such analyzes need to be replayed frequently to take into account new vulnerabilities, new protections, etc. As exploits can now easily be found on internet, allowing a wide range of possible intruders with various capacities, motivations and resources. In particular in the case of industrial control systems (also called SCADA) that interact with the physical world, any breach can lead to disasters for humans and the environment. Alongside of classical security properties such as secrecy or authentication, SCADA must ensure safety properties relative to the industrial process they control. In this paper, we propose an approach to assess the security of industrial systems. This approach aims to find applicative attacks taking into account various parameters such as the behavior of the process, the safety properties that must be ensured. We also model the possible positions and capacities of attackers allowing a precise control of these attackers. We instrument our approach using the well known model-checker UPPAAL, we apply it on a case study and show how variations of properties, network topologies, and attacker models can drastically change the obtained results.},

This is also the first academic paper to formally propose measurement units for cyber risk. In this paper, multidisciplinary methodologies are used to apply proven risk measurement methods in finance and medicine to define novel risk units central to cybernomics. Leveraging established risk units – MicroMort (MM) for measuring medical risk and Value-at-Risk (VaR) for measuring market risk – BitMort (BM) and hekla (named after an Icelandic volcano) are defined as cyber risk units. Risk calculation methods and examples are introduced in this paper to measure cost-effectiveness of control factors, articulate an entity's “willingness-to-pay” (risk pricing) for cyber risk reduction, cyber risk limit, and cyber risk appetite. Built around BM and hekla, cybernomics integrates cyber risk management and economics to study the requirements of a databank in order to improve risk analytics solutions for: 1) the valuation of digital assets; 2) the measurement of risk exposure of digital assets; and 3) the capital optimization for managing residual cyber risk. Establishing adequate, holistic and statistically robust data points on the entity, portfolio and global levels for the development of a cybernomics databank are essential for the resilience of our shared digital future. This paper explains the need to establish data schemes such as International Digital Asset Classification (IDAC) and International Classification of Cyber Incidents (ICCI).},

The analysis considers threat likelihood, the cost of security measures, hazard likelihood, risk reduction and expected losses to compare the costs and benefits of security measures to decide the optimal security measures to airports. Monte-Carlo simulation methods were used to propagate hazard likelihood, risk reduction and loss uncertainties in the calculation of net benefits that also allows probability of cost-effectiveness to be calculated. It is found that attack probabilities had to be much higher than currently observed to justify additional protective measures. Overall, then, it is questionable whether special efforts to further protect airports are sensible expenditures. Indeed, some relaxation of the measures already in place may well be justified.},

We argue that an effective Cyber-Physical Defense can only be elaborated if possible attacks on CPS can be identified and assessed in a systematic manner. In this paper, we focus on cyber-attacks only. Our contribution in this paper is the following. We assess the applicability of Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) for the systematic analysis of cyber-attacks against CPS. In this context, we introduce several extensions to DFD. We evaluate the analysis procedure by applying it on a comparatively simple example of a quad-rotor UAV. The selected UAV is fully functioning and contains multiple structural elements representative for more complex systems. At the same time, its simplicity enables an in-depth manual analysis. Our analysis shows that cyber-attacks executed against CPS can lead to various cyber-physical interactions. This, in turn, creates novel challenges for CPS defense. Finally, we outline the preliminary results of our work towards a Taxonomy of Cyber-Physical Attacks.},

Such a chain is called an attack path, and the set of all possible attack paths form an attack graph. Researchers have proposed a variety of methods to generate attack graphs. In this paper, we provide a novel alternative approach to network vulnerability analysis by utilizing a penetration tester's perspective of maximal level of penetration possible on a host. Our approach has the following benefits: it provides a more intuitive model in which an analyst can work, and its algorithmic complexity is polynomial in the size of the network, and so has the potential of scaling well to practical networks. The drawback is that we track only "good" attack paths, as opposed to all possible attack paths. Hence, an analyst may make suboptimal choices when repairing the network. Since attack graphs grow exponentially with the size of the network, we argue that suboptimal solutions are an unavoidable cost of scalability, and hence practical utility. A working prototype tool has been implemented to demonstrate the practicality of our approach},

Various standardization groups claim that they provide mechanisms to express semantics or allow the integration of semantic information. The emerging data format AutomationML (as IEC 62714) proposes a role-based approach to encode semantics in engineering models and has already standardized fundamental engineering concepts as role classes. However, for concrete data processing tasks the currently standardized role classes are not sufficient to unambiguously express the meaning of various vendor or application specific concepts, while user-defined role classes rely on hand wired semantics encoded in dedicated software, e.g. importer/exporters. Yet AutomationML system unit classes represent reusable engineering objects as relational models of AutomationML roles, attributes, interfaces, internal elements and links, which can be used to describe complex user-specific concepts. To enable an automatic machine interpretation of these unstandardized relational models, we transform AutomationML data to a formal and declarative semantic representation using the Web Ontology Language (OWL), and propose a rule mining approach to learn the intended meaning of user selected system unit classes, i.e. to identify the common relational structure shared by the selected engineering objects.},

These initiatives have been followed by practical implementations that popularize OWL in various domains. For example, OWL has been used for conceptual modeling in industrial engineering, and its reasoning facilities are used to provide a wealth of services, e.g. model diagnosis, automated code generation, and semantic integration. More specifically, recent studies have shown that OWL is well suited for harmonizing information of engineering systems stored as AutomationML (AML) files. However, OWL and its tools can be cumbersome for direct use by domain experts such that an ontology expert is often required in practice. Although much attention has been paid in the literature to overcome this issue by transforming OWL ontologies from/to AML models automatically, dealing with OWL complex classes remains an open research question. In this paper, we introduce the AML concept models for representing OWL complex classes in AutomationML, and present algorithms for the bidirectional translation between OWL complex classes and their corresponding AML concept models. We show that this approach provides an efficient and intuitive interface for domain experts to visualize, modify, and create OWL complex classes in typical ontology engineering tasks.},

Cybersecurity constitutes a particularly interesting domain for the development of a domain-specific public knowledge graph, particularly due to its highly dynamic landscape characterized by time-critical, dispersed, and heterogeneous information. To build and continually maintain a knowledge graph, we provide and describe an integrated set of resources, including vocabularies derived from well-established standards in the cybersecurity domain, an ETL workflow that updates the knowledge graph as new information becomes available, and a set of services that provide integrated access through multiple interfaces. The resulting semantic resource offers comprehensive and integrated up-to-date instance information to security researchers and professionals alike. Furthermore, it can be easily linked to locally available information, as we demonstrate by means of two use cases in the context of vulnerability assessment and intrusion detection.},

  abstract = {Perceiving and understanding cyber-attacks can be a difficult task, and more effective techniques are needed to aid cyber-attack perception. Attack modelling techniques (AMTs) - such as attack graphs, attack trees and fault trees, are a popular method of mathematically and visually representing the sequence of events that lead to a successful cyber-attack. These methods are useful visual aids that can aid cyber-attack perception. This survey paper describes the fundamental theory of cyber-attack before describing how important elements of a cyber-attack are represented in attack graphs and attack trees. The key focus of the paper is to present empirical research aimed at analysing more than 180 attack graphs and attack trees to identify how attack graphs and attack trees present cyber-attacks in terms of their visual syntax. There is little empirical or comparative research which evaluates the effectiveness of these methods. Furthermore, despite their popularity, there is no standardised attack graph visual syntax configuration, and more than seventy self-nominated attack graph and twenty attack tree configurations have been described in the literature — each of which presents attributes such as preconditions and exploits in a different way. The survey demonstrates that there is no standard method of representing attack graphs or attack trees and that more research is needed to standardise the representation.},

The model then simulates the attack behavior of the adversaries to produce a quantitative assessment of system security strength. This paper describes the system and adversary characterization data that are collected as input for the executable model. This paper also describes the simulation algorithms for adversary attack behavior and the computation for the probability that an attack attempt is successful. A simple case study illustrates how to analyze system security using the ADVISE method. A tool is currently under development to facilitate automatic model generation and simulation. The ADVISE method aggregates security-relevant information about a system and its adversaries to produce a quantitative security analysis useful for holistic system security decisions.},

  abstract = {Automation in cyber security can be achieved by using attack graphs. Attack graphs allow us to model possible paths that a potential attacker can use to intrude into a target network. In particular, graph representation is often used to increase visibility of information, but it is not effective when a large-scale attack graph is produced. However, it is inevitable that such a voluminous attack graph is generated by modeling a variety of data from an increasing number of network hosts. Therefore, we need more intelligent ways of inferring the knowledge required to harden network security from the attack graph, beyond getting information such as possible attack paths. Ontology technology enables a machine to understand information and makes it easier to infer knowledge based on relational facts from big data. Constructing ontology in the domain of attack graph generation is a prerequisite for increasing machine intelligence and implementing an automated process. In this paper, we propose a semantic approach to make a large-scale attack graph machine readable. The approach provides several benefits. First, users can obtain relational facts based on reasoning from a large-scale attack graph, and the semantics of an attack graph can provide intuition to users. In addition, intelligence-based security assessment can be possible using the obtained ontological structures. By improving the machine readability of an attack graph, our approach could lead to automated assessment of network security.},

This paper describes how probabilistic relational models can be used to specify architecture metamodels so that security risk can be inferred from metamodel instantiations. A probabilistic relational model contains classes, attributes, and class-relationships. It can be used to specify architectural metamodels similar to class diagrams in the Unified Modeling Language. In addition, a probabilistic relational model makes it possible to associate a probabilistic dependency model to the attributes of classes in the architectural metamodel. This paper proposes a set of abstract classes that can be used to create probabilistic relational models so that they enable inference of security risk from instantiated architecture models. If an architecture metamodel is created by specializing the abstract classes proposed in this paper, the instantiations of the metamodel will generate a probabilistic dependency model that can be used to calculate the security risk associated with these instantiations. The abstract classes make it possible to derive the dependency model and calculate security risk from an instance model that only specifies assets and their relationships to each other. Hence, the person instantiating the architecture metamodel is not required to assess complex security attributes to quantify security risk using the instance model.},

In this paper, we present IDP, a system for solving MX problems that integrates technology from ASP and SAT. Its strenght lies both in its rich input language and its efficiency. IDP is the first model expansion system that can handle full FO, but its language extends FO with many other primitives such as inductive definitions, aggregates, quantifiers with numerical constraints, order-sorted types, arithmetic, partial functions, etc. We show that this allows for a natural, compact representation of many interesting search problems. Despite the generality of its language, our experiments show that the IDP system belongs to the most efficient ASP and MX systems.},

  abstract  = {An alternative to automata for untimed models of DES is provided by Petri nets. These models were first developed by C. A. Petri in the early 1960s. As we will see, Petri nets are related to automata in the sense that they also explicitly represent the transition function of DES. Like an automaton, a Petri net is a device that manipulates events according to certain rules. One of its features is that it includes explicit conditions under which an event can be enabled; this allows the representation of very general DES whose operation depends on potentially complex control schemes. This representation is conveniently described graphically, at least for small systems, resulting in Petri net graphs; Petri net graphs are intuitive and capture a lot of structural information about the system. We will see that an automaton can always be represented as a Petri net; on the other hand, not all Petri nets can be represented as finite-stateautomata. Consequently, Petri nets can represent a larger class of languages than the class of regular languages, R. Another motivation for considering Petri net models of DES is the body of analysis techniques that have been developed for studying them. These techniques include reachability analysis, similarly to the case of automata, as well as linear-algebraic techniques. Such techniques cover not only untimed Petri net models but timed Petri net models as well; in this regard, we will see in the next chapter that there is a well-developed theory, called the ``max-plus algebra,'' for a certain class of timed Petri nets (cf. Sect. 5.4). Finally, we mention that control of Petri nets is an active research area and there are controller synthesis techniques that exploit the structural properties of Petri nets.},

We measure risk in terms of the extent to which an attacker can manipulate process control elements, the consequences due to disruption of the controlled physical process, and the vulnerability of the SCADA system to malicious intrusion. The technique constitutes a novel application of Petri net state coverability analysis coupled with process simulation. As such, this framework permits a formal assessment of candidate policies to manage risk by diminishing aspects of the network vulnerability to intrusion, where the objective is to prevent malicious induction of catastrophic process failure modes. We extend earlier work on Petri nets for attack analysis by developing a detailed methodology including: a new algorithm for the automatic generation of Petri nets from the description of a SCADA network and its vulnerabilities; metrics for quantifying risk as a function of a Petri net's state; techniques for evaluating these metrics based on a Petri net's minimal coverability set; and a method for coupling the Petri net representation of the SCADA network to the controlled processes for failure mode and effects assessment. The paper concludes by presenting an example application of the analysis technique to evaluate the security of a hazardous liquid loading process.},

Providing a simple interface was a major design goal such that it is as easy as possible to integrate LoLA into tools of different application domains. LoLA supports place/transition nets. Implemented verification techniques cover standard properties (liveness, reversibility, boundedness, reachability, dead transitions, deadlocks, home states) as well as satisfiability of state predicates and CTL model checking. For satisfiability, both exhaustive search and heuristically goal oriented system execution are supported. For state space reduction, LoLA features symmetries, stubborn sets, and coverability graphs.},

  abstract = {One of the key advantages of additive manufacturing (AM) is its digital thread, which allows for rapid communication, iteration, and sharing of a design model and its corresponding physical representation. While this enables a more efficient design process, it also presents opportunities for cyber-attacks to impact the physical word. In this paper the authors examine potential attack vectors along the Additive Manufacturing process chain. Specifically, the effects of cyber-physical attacks, and potential means for detecting them, are explored. To explore the potential implications of such an attack, a case study was conducted to evaluate the ability of human subjects to detect and diagnose a cyber-physical attack on the STL file of a test specimen. Based on the results of this study, recommendations are presented for preventing and detecting cyber-physical attacks on AM processes.},

  abstract = {Vulnerability assessment is a requirement of NERC's cybersecurity standards for electric power systems. The purpose is to study the impact of a cyber attack on supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. Compliance of the requirement to meet the standard has become increasingly challenging as the system becomes more dispersed in wide areas. Interdependencies between computer communication system and the physical infrastructure also become more complex as information technologies are further integrated into devices and networks. This paper proposes a vulnerability assessment framework to systematically evaluate the vulnerabilities of SCADA systems at three levels: <i>system</i>, <i>scenarios</i>, and <i>access</i> <i>points</i>. The proposed method is based on cyber systems embedded with the firewall and password models, the primary mode of protection in the power industry today. The impact of a potential electronic intrusion is evaluated by its potential loss of load in the power system. This capability is enabled by integration of a logic-based simulation method and a module for the power flow computation. The IEEE 30-bus system is used to evaluate the impact of attacks launched from outside or from within the substation networks. Countermeasures are identified for improvement of the cybersecurity.},

The theory takes advantage of concurrency, or more generally, of the lack of interaction between transitions, captured by the notion of stubborn sets. The basic method preserves all terminal states and the existence of nontermination. A more advanced version suited to the analysis of properties of reactive systems is developed. It is shown how the method can be used to detect violations of invariant properties. The method preserves the liveness (in Petri net sense) of transitions, and livelocks which cannot be exited. A modification of the method is given which preserves the language generated by the system. The theory is developed in an abstract variable/transition framework and adapted to elementary Petri nets, place/transition nets with infinite capacity of places, and coloured Petri nets.},

In their basic form, they consist of enumerating and analysing the set of the states the system can ever reach. Unfortunately, the number of states of even a relatively small system is often far greater than can be handled in a realistic computer. The goal of this article is to analyse this state explosion problem from several perspectives. Many advanced state space methods alleviate the problem by using a subset or an abstraction of the set of states. Unfortunately, their use tends to restrict the set of analysis or verification questions that can be answered, making it impossible to discuss the methods without some taxonomy of the questions. Therefore, the article contains a lengthy discussion on alternative ways of stating analysis and verification questions, and algorithms for answering them. After that, many advanced state space methods are briefly described. The state explosion problem is investigated also from the computational complexity point of view.},

The framework incorporates a novel application of Petri net state coverability analysis coupled with process failure mode analysis. It extends previous work on Petri nets for attack analysis in three ways: (i) new metrics that quantify risk as a function of Petri net state and techniques for evaluating the metrics based on the minimal coverability set of a Petri net; (ii) a new method for coupling a Petri net representation of a computer network attack to a process failure modes model; and (iii) a new method for identifying high-value risk management opportunities. The paper concludes by presenting an application of the analysis techniques to evaluate risk in process control networks.},

Subsequently securing a system, that is, integrating security mechanisms into the system's architecture can itself impact the system's safety, for instance deadlines could be missed due to an increase in computations and communications latencies. SysML-Sec addresses these issues with a model-driven approach that promotes the collaboration between system designers and security experts at all design and development stages, e.g., requirements, attacks, partitioning, design, and validation. A central point of SysML-Sec is its partitioning stage during which safety-related and security-related functions are explored jointly and iteratively with regards to requirements and attacks. Once partitioned, the system is designed in terms of system's functions and security mechanisms, and formally verified from both the safety and the security perspectives. Our paper illustrates the whole methodology with the evaluation of a security mechanism added to an existing automotive system.},

  abstract  = {Industrial control systems (ICSs), and particularly supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, are used in many critical infrastructures and are inherently insecure, making them desirable targets for attackers. ICS networks differ from typical enterprise networks in their characteristics and goals; therefore, security assessment methods that are common in enterprise networks (e.g., penetration testing) cannot be directly applied in ICSs. Thus, security experts recommend using an isolated environment that mimics the real one for assessing the security of ICSs. While the use of such environments solves the main challenge in ICS security analysis, it poses another one: the trade-off between budget and fidelity. In this paper we suggest a method for creating a digital twin that is network-specific, cost-efficient, highly reliable, and security test-oriented. The proposed method consists of two modules: a problem builder that takes facts about the system under test and converts them into a rules set that reflects the system's topology and digital twin implementation constraints; and a solver that takes these inputs and uses 0--1 non-linear programming to find an optimal solution (i.e., a digital twin specification), which satisfies all of the constraints. We demonstrate the application of our method on a simple use case of a simplified ICS network.},

The Digital Twin-based privacy enhancement demonstrator is designed to simulate variety of conditions that can occur in the smart car ecosystem. We firstly identify the core stakeholders (actors) in the smart car ecosystem, their roles and exposure to privacy vulnerabilities and associated risks. Secondly, we identify assets that consume and generate sensitive privacy data in smart cars, their functionalities, and relevant privacy concerns and risks. Thirdly, we design an infrastructure for collecting (i) real-time sensor data from smart cars and their assets, and (ii) environmental data, road and traffic data, generated through operational driving lifecycle. In order to ensure compliance of the collected data with privacy policies and regulations, e.g. with GDPR requirements for enforcement of the data subject's rights, we design methods for the Digital Twin-based privacy enhancement demonstrator that are based on behavioural analytics informed by GDPR. We also perform data anonymization to minimize privacy risks and enable actions such as sending an automatic informed consent to the stakeholders.},

When the parts are fitted to each other, jamming may occur, leading to assembly failure or damage to the parts, to the robot, or to its enviroment. Therefore, an intrinsically safe environment is required for the developement and testing of new algorithms. In this paper we present a workflow for developing control algorithms by means of a Virtual Testbed: First, we create a virtual setup to test and optimize the algorithm in simulation. This setup comprises a digital twin of the used physical manipulator and an application-oriented virtual environment for its operation. Then an algorithm for peg-in-hole insertion is developed that copes successfully with peg and hole fitted to each other with small clearances. This algorithm is tested and validated using the digital twin within the simulation. After its successfully validation in a virtual testbed, the algorithm is transfered to a physical setup containing the physical KUKA LWR4 manipulator and manufactured assembly parts.},

The eRobotics methodology addresses this evolution by providing platforms where roboticist can exchange ideas and collaborate with experts from other disciplines for developing complex technical systems and automated solutions. Virtual Testbeds are the central method in eRobotics, where complex technical systems and their interaction with prospective working environments are first designed, programmed, controlled and optimized in simulation before commissioning the real system. On the other hand, Industry 4.0 concepts promote the notion of “Digital Twins”, virtual substitutes of real world objects consisting of virtual representations and communication capabilities making up smart objects acting as intelligent nodes inside the internet of things and services. Combining these two approaches, Virtual Testbeds and Digital Twins, leads to a new kind of “Experimentable Digital Twins” breaking new ground in the simulation-based development and operation of complex technical systems. In this contribution, we describe how such “Experimentable Digital Twins” can act as the very core of simulation-based development processes streamlining the development process, enabling detailed simulations at system level and realizing intelligent systems. Besides this, the multiple use of models and simulations in various scenarios significantly reduces the effort for the use of simulation technology throughout the life cycle of complex technical systems.},

Contemporary researchers recommend integrating cloud technologies in the CPS cyber layer to ensure the scalability of storage, computation, and cross domain communication capabilities. Though there exist a few descriptive models of the cloud-based CPS architecture, it is important to analytically describe the key CPS properties: computation, control, and communication. In this paper, we present a digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based CPS, C2PS, where we analytically describe the key properties of the C2PS. The model helps in identifying various degrees of basic and hybrid computation-interaction modes in this paradigm. We have designed C2PS smart interaction controller using a Bayesian belief network, so that the system dynamically considers current contexts. The composition of fuzzy rule base with the Bayes network further enables the system with reconfiguration capability. We also describe analytically, how C2PS subsystem communications can generate even more complex system-of-systems. Later, we present a telematics-based prototype driving assistance application for the vehicular domain of C2PS, VCPS, to demonstrate the efficacy of the architecture reference model.},

  abstract = {Concerning current approaches to planning of manufacturing processes, the acquisition of a sufficient data basis of the relevant process information and subsequent development of feasible layout options requires 74\% of the overall time-consumption. However, the application of fully automated techniques within planning processes is not yet common practice. Deficits are to be observed in the course of the use of a fully automated data acquisition of the underlying process data, a key element of Industry 4.0, as well as the evaluation and quantification and analysis of the gathered data. As the majority of the planning operations are conducted manually, the lack of any theoretical evaluation renders a benchmarking of the results difficult. Current planning processes analyze the manually achieved results with the aid of simulation. Evaluation and quantification of the planning procedure are limited by complexity that defies manual controllability. Research is therefore required with regard to automated data acquisition and selection, as the near real-time evaluation and analysis of a highly complex production systems relies on a real-time generated database. The paper presents practically feasible approaches to a multi-modal data acquisition approach, its requirements and limitations. The further concept of the Digital Twin for a production process enables a coupling of the production system with its digital equivalent as a base for an optimization with a minimized delay between the time of data acquisition and the creation of the Digital Twin. Therefore a digital data acquisition approach is necessary. As a consequence a cyber-physical production system can be generated, that opens up powerful applications. To ensure a maximum concordance of the cyber-physical process with its real-life model a multimodal data acquisition and evaluation has to be conducted. The paper therefore presents a concept for the composition of a database and proposes guidelines for the implementation of the Digital Twin in production systems in small and medium-sized enterprises.},

  abstract  = {Digital Twin (DT) is being considered a significant enabler for Industry 4.0 initiatives. Within Industry 4.0, the amount of digital product information generated and collected over the entire lifecycle has been growing. Current information and communication technologies, including data storage, data processing, and wireless data transmission, may be leveraged to digitally mirror the lifecycle of a corresponding physical product with increasing level of detail. A DT creates a link between physical products and their virtual models with more comprehensive data and accumulation of knowledge. Therefore, a DT may be applied to enhance simulation, traceability and to support the offering of value-added services along the lifecycle. However, the definition of a DT and its requirements are not yet fully established. The characteristics a DT model should possess to be widely used in manufacturing remains an open question in the literature. The concept is still broad and dependent on the lifecycle stage and industry sector of application. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to propose an initial synthesis of DT requirements based on a literature review and industry interviews. The literature review focuses on the content analysis of papers published from 2010 to 2018 and indexed in the ISI Web of Science database. The interviews were conducted with industry representatives in Brazil. The results show that DT requirements are related to real-time data, integration, and fidelity. Besides, it shows that industry requirements are close to literature and the actual implementation of DT is the future of research in this field.},

It is used slightly different over the disparate disciplines.

Therefore, it is distinct between Digital Model (DM), Digital Shadow (DS) and Digital Twin. The results are showing, that literature concerning the highest development stage, the DT, is scarce, whilst there is more literature about DM and DS.},

In this chapter we focus on the simulation aspects of the Digital Twin. Today, modelling and simulation is a standard process in system development, e.g. to support design tasks or to validate system properties. During operation and for service first simulation-based solutions are realized for optimized operations and failure prediction. In this sense, simulation merges the physical and virtual world in all life cycle phases. Current practice already enables the users (designer, SW/HW developers, test engineers, operators, maintenance personnel, etc) to master the complexity of mechatronic systems.},

This keynote paper investigates the major milestones in the evolution of simulation technologies and examines recent industrial and research applications and findings. Based on this review, the identification of gaps in current practices is presented, and future trends and challenges to be met on the field are outlined. The considered simulation methods and tools include CAx, Factory layout design, Material and Information flow design, Manufacturing Networks Design, Manufacturing Systems Planning and Control, Manufacturing Networks Planning and Control, Augmented and Virtual Reality in product and process design, planning and verification (ergonomics, robotics, etc.). The evolution, advances, current practices and future trends of these technologies, industrial applications and research results are discussed in the context of the contemporary manufacturing industry.},

The issues leading to undesirable and unpredicted emergent behavior are set in place during the phases of creation and production and realized during the operational phase, with many of those problematic issues due to human interaction. We propose that the idea of the Digital Twin, which links the physical system with its virtual equivalent can mitigate these problematic issues. We describe the Digital Twin concept and its development, show how it applies across the product lifecycle in defining and understanding system behavior, and define tests to evaluate how we are progressing. We discuss how the Digital Twin relates to Systems Engineering and how it can address the human interactions that lead to ``normal accidents.'' We address both Digital Twin obstacles and opportunities, such as system replication and front running. We finish with NASA's current work with the Digital Twin.},

Most of the existing research work on SCADA systems has focused on addressing SCADA security by monitoring attacks or anomalies at the network level. The main issue affecting these systems today is that by focusing our attention on network-level monitoring needs, security practitioners may remain unaware of process level constraints. The proposed framework helps ensure that a mechanism is in place to help map process level constraints, as described by process engineers, to network level monitoring needs. Existing solutions have tried to address this problem but have not been able to fully bridge the gap between the process and the network. The goal of this research is to provide a solution that (i) leverages the knowledge process engineers have about the system (to help strengthen cyber security) and that has the ability to (ii) seamlessly monitors process constraints at the network level using standard network security tools. A prototype system for the Modbus TCP protocol and the Bro IDS has been built to validate the approach.},

This process is well suited for a wide variety of studies including both plant-wide control and multivariable control problems. It consists of a reactor/ separator/recycle arrangement involving two simultaneous gas—liquid exothermic reactions of the following form: A(g) + C(g) + D(g) → G(liq), Product 1, A(g) + C(g) + E(g) → H(liq), Product 2. Two additional byproduct reactions also occur. The process has 12 valves available for manipulation and 41 measurements available for monitoring or control. The process equipment, operating objectives, process control objectives and process disturbances are described. A set of FORTRAN subroutines which simulate the process are available upon request. The chemical process model presented here is a challenging problem for a wide variety of process control technology studies. Even though this process has only a few unit operations, it is much more complex than it appears on first examination. We hope that this problem will be useful in the development of the process control field. We are also interested in hearing about applications of the problem.},

Both the source code used to generate the results in this paper and a compiled version are available to the public, and the paper discusses how they can be obtained. The modeling approach used and differences from the earlier VAC model are discussed in detail. Simulations are presented that show the agreement with earlier results. The goal of the paper is to provide a readily available simulation that can be used as a test bed for advanced control approaches, such as plantwide control design and optimization, model predictive control, and process monitoring.},

Resilient control is a new topic of control technologies which studies how to maintain acceptable level of operation or service in face of undesirable incidents. This emerging technology, applied to industrial control systems, can provide a certain degree of protection for critical infrastructure, such as electric power generation, transmission and distribution, oil and gas production, water treatment. This paper proposes a 3-layer system model and resilience curve, discusses the concept and presents definition, properties and some insights of resilient industrial control systems. The metrics to estimate resilience quantitatively is disclosed. The general approaches to build, operate and improve a resilience industrial control system are proposed as well. Cyber attack resilient power grid automation system is discussed to illustrate the proposed approaches.},

A feedback structure that allows an attacker to take over control of the plant while remaining hidden from the control and supervisory system(s) is presented.

Honeypots are vulnerable systems that are set up with the intent to be probed and compromised by attackers. Analysis of those attacks then allows the defender to learn about novel attacks and general strategy of the attacker. Honeypots for ICS systems need to satisfy both traditional ICT requirements, such as cost and maintainability, and more specific ICS requirements, such as time and determinism. We propose the design of a virtual, high-interaction and server-based ICS honeypot to satisfy the requirements, and the deployment of a realistic, cost-effective, and maintainable ICS honeypot. An attacker model is introduced to complete the problem statement and requirements. Based on our design and the MiniCPS framework, we implemented a honeypot mimicking a water treatment testbed. To the best of our knowledge, the presented honeypot implementation is the first academic work targeting Ethernet/IP based ICS honeypots, the first ICS virtual honeypot that is high-interactive without the use of full virtualization technologies (such as a network of virtual machines), and the first ICS honeypot that can be managed with a Software-Defined Network (SDN) controller.},

  abstract  = {In the last years there has been an increasing interest in the security of process control and SCADA systems. Furthermore, recent computer attacks such as the Stuxnet worm, have shown there are parties with the motivation and resources to effectively attack control systems.

While previous work has proposed new security mechanisms for control systems, few of them have explored new and fundamentally different research problems for securing control systems when compared to securing traditional information technology (IT) systems. In particular, the sophistication of new malware attacking control systems--malware including zero-days attacks, rootkits created for control systems, and software signed by trusted certificate authorities--has shown that it is very difficult to prevent and detect these attacks based solely on IT system information.

In this paper we show how, by incorporating knowledge of the physical system under control, we are able to detect computer attacks that change the behavior of the targeted control system. By using knowledge of the physical system we are able to focus on the final objective of the attack, and not on the particular mechanisms of how vulnerabilities are exploited, and how the attack is hidden. We analyze the security and safety of our mechanisms by exploring the effects of stealthy attacks, and by ensuring that automatic attack-response mechanisms will not drive the system to an unsafe state.

A secondary goal of this paper is to initiate the discussion between control and security practitioners--two areas that have had little interaction in the past. We believe that control engineers can leverage security engineering to design--based on a combination of their best practices--control algorithms that go beyond safety and fault tolerance, and include considerations to survive targeted attacks.},

The analysis of the classification scheme of the taxonomy allows getting an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of each criterion value.

In this paper we present a novel honeypot capable of detecting multi-stage attacks targeting ICS networks. Upon detecting a multi-stage attack, our honeypot can generate signatures so that misuse Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) can subsequently thwart attacks of the same type. Our experimental results indicate that our honeypot and the signatures it generates provide good detection accuracy and that the Bro IDS can successfully use the signatures to prevent future attacks.},

As a lure for attackers, honeypots provide the researchers with great assistance of industrial security research, and also plays a certain role in the protection of industrial system security. Honeypot is designed to a vulnerable system with the purpose of luring attackers to compromise it. Simultaneously, it also collects valuable data from attackers under the ground, then researchers will extract useful information from the data and then convert it to threat intelligence, which can be used to found attackers' behaviors or strategies and protect realistic systems. The honeypot for ICS need not only meet the needs of traditional information control technology, such as cost and maintainability, but also meet the needs of ICSs, such as timing and decision strategies. The research focuses on the design and implementation of high interactive honeypot for ICSs. It puts forward a method, which improves the interaction of the ICSs' honeypot from two aspects-HMI (Human Machine Interface) and industrial protocols' simulation. At the same time, we designed and implemented a virtual and high interactive honeypot and deployed it which is based on the improved conpot project to simulate SIEMENS S7-400 series' PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers).},

However, the confluence of all these technologies and the implicit interaction with the physical counterpart of the DT in the real world generate multiple security threats that have not yet been sufficiently studied. In that context, this paper analyzes the current state of the DT paradigm and classifies the potential threats associated with it, taking into consideration its functionality layers and the operational requirements in order to achieve a more complete and useful classification. We also provide a preliminary set of security recommendations and approaches that can help to ensure the appropriate and trustworthy use of a DT.},

The concept of a digital twin allows for the analysis, design, optimisation and evolution of systems to take place fully digital, or in conjunction with a cyber-physical system to improve speed, accuracy and efficiency when compared to traditional engineering approaches. Digital twins continue to be a technology that enables new paradigms, such as Industry 4.0 and Factories of the Future as well as generating improved efficiencies within existing systems. The development of digital twin technology in traditional industries such as manufacturing, construction, the automotive industry, agriculture and transportation has highlighted its potential, but often insufficiently explored the risks associated with their integration. In this paper we explore risks relating to the cyber-security of systems employing digital twin technology and also consider the opportunities for digital twins themselves to mitigate cyber-security risks and become an integral part of a security in-depth defence.},

While a great amount of research has been conducted on network security of office and home networks, recently the security of CPS and related systems has gained increased attention. Unfortunately, real-world CPS are often not open to security researchers, and as a result very few reference physical-layer processes, control systems and communication topologies are available. In this work, we present MiniCPS, a toolkit intended to alleviate this problem. The goal of MiniCPS is to create an extensible, reproducible research environment for network communications, control systems, and physical-layer interactions in CPS. Instead of focusing on a customized simulation settings for specific subsystems, the main goal is to establish a framework to connect together real CPS soft- and hardware, simulation scripts for such components, and physical-layer simulation engines. MiniCPS builds on Mininet to provide lightweight real-time network emulation, and extends Mininet with tools to simulate typical CPS components such as programmable logic controllers, which use industrial protocols (eg. EtherNet/IP, Modbus/TCP). To capture physical-layer interactions, MiniCPS defines a simple API to connect to physical-layer simulations. We demonstrate applications of MiniCPS in two example scenarios, and show how MiniCPS can be used to develop attacks and defenses that are directly applicable to real systems.},

Nevertheless, this has not only exposed NCIs to typical ICT systems attacks, but also to a new breed of cyber-physical attacks. To alleviate these issues, in this paper we propose a novel approach for detecting cyber-physical anomalies in NCIs using the concept of Cyber-physical data fusion. By employing Dempster-Shafer's “Theory of Evidence” we combine knowledge from the cyber and physical dimension of NCIs in order to achieve an Anomaly Detection System (ADS) capable to detect even small disturbances that are not detected by traditional approaches. The proposed ADS is validated in a scenario assessing the consequences of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and the propagation of such disturbances to the operation of a simulated power grid.},

Some of the controlled processes belong to Critical Infrastructures (CIs), and, as such, IN protection is an active research field. Among different types of security solutions, IN Anomaly Detection Systems (ADSs) have received wide attention from the scientific community. While INs have grown in size and in complexity, requiring the development of novel, Big Data solutions for data processing, IN ADSs have not evolved at the same pace. In parallel, the development of Big Data frameworks such as Hadoop or Spark has led the way for applying Big Data Analytics to the field of cyber-security, mainly focusing on the Information Technology (IT) domain. However, due to the particularities of INs, it is not feasible to directly apply IT security mechanisms in INs, as IN ADSs face unique characteristics. In this work we introduce three main contributions. First, we survey the area of Big Data ADSs that could be applicable to INs and compare the surveyed works. Second, we develop a novel taxonomy to classify existing IN-based ADSs. And, finally, we present a discussion of open problems in the field of Big Data ADSs for INs that can lead to further development.},

While intrusion detection systems are suited to detect network-based attacks, they remain unable to detect more sophisticated attacks against control systems, for example a compromise of the PLCs. This paper makes the case that the evolving landscape of threats such as the Stuxnet malware requires an alternative approach to intrusion detection in industrial control systems. We argue that effective control of such advanced threats needs to happen in the last link of the control network, hence building a last line of defense. A proof of concept of this new paradigm was implemented for the control system of a dredging vessel, and we describe main lessons learned and pose open research questions we find based on these experiences for ICS intrusion detection.},

Weaknesses in the application layer protocols, however, leave SCADA networks vulnerable to attack. In response, cyber security researchers have developed myriad intrusion detection systems. Researchers primarily rely on unique threat models and the corresponding network traffic data sets to train and validate their intrusion detection systems. This leads to a situation in which researchers cannot independently verify the results, cannot compare the effectiveness of different intrusion detection systems, and cannot adequately validate the ability of intrusion detection systems to detect various classes of attacks. Indeed, a common data set is needed that can be used by researchers to compare intrusion detection approaches and implementations. This paper describes four data sets, which include network traffic, process control and process measurement features from a set of 28 attacks against two laboratory-scale industrial control systems that use the MODBUS application layer protocol. The data sets, which are freely available, enable effective comparisons of intrusion detection solutions for SCADA systems.},

However, the question of whether this promise can be realized in practice has remained open. We answer this question in this paper, based on our experience in building a specification-based intrusion detection system and experimenting with it. Our experiments included the 1999 DARPA/AFRL online evaluation, as well as experiments conducted using 1999 DARPA/Lincoln Labs offline evaluation data. These experiments show that an effective specification-based IDS can be developed with modest efforts. They also show that the specification-based techniques live up to their promise of detecting known as well as unknown attacks, while maintaining a very low rate of false positives.},

A number of vendors offer scalable and high-performance wireless networks but at a high cost and commonly as a single-vendor solution, limiting the ability to innovate after roll-out. Recent Software-Defined Networking (SDN) approaches propose new means for network virtualization and programmability advancing the way networks can be designed and operated, including user-defined features and customized behaviour even at run-time. However, means for rapid prototyping and experimental evaluation of SDN for wireless environments are not yet available. This paper introduces Mininet-WiFi as a tool to emulate wireless OpenFlow/SDN scenarios allowing high-fidelity experiments that replicate real networking environments. Mininet-WiFi augments the well-known Mininet emulator with virtual wireless stations and access points while keeping the original SDN capabilities and the lightweight virtualization software architecture. We elaborate on the potential applications of Mininet-Wifi and discuss the benefits and current limitations.

We implement and evaluate our anomaly detection technique on a real-world ICS. We pre-compute the process-state parameters using a big data framework for ICS and train the detector leveraging more than 120 GB of historical data from the ICS. The results show that the proposed method improves prior works by providing less time-to-detect of attacks while generating fewer false alarms.},

  abstract  = {Off-the-shelf intrusion detection systems prove an ill fit for protecting industrial control systems, as they do not take their process semantics into account. Specifically, current systems fail to detect recent process control attacks that manifest as unauthorized changes to the configuration of a plant's programmable logic controllers (PLCs). In this work we present a detector that continuously tracks updates to corresponding process variables to then derive variable-specific prediction models as the basis for assessing future activity. Taking a specification-agnostic approach, we passively monitor plant activity by extracting variable updates from the devices' network communication. We evaluate the capabilities of our detection approach with traffic recorded at two operational water treatment plants serving a total of about one million people in two urban areas. We show that the proposed approach can detect direct attacks on process control, and we further explore its potential to identify more sophisticated indirect attacks on field device measurements as well.},

  abstract  = {Current intrusion detection systems (IDS) for industrial control systems (ICS) mostly involve the retrofitting of conventional network IDSs, such as SNORT. Such an approach is prone to missing highly targeted and specific attacks against ICS. Where ICS-specific approaches exist, they often rely on passive network monitoring techniques, offering a low cost solution, and avoiding any computational overhead arising from actively polling ICS devices. However, the use of passive approaches alone could fail in the detection of attacks that alter the behaviour of ICS devices (as was the case in Stuxnet). Where active solutions exist, they can be resource-intensive, posing the risk of overloading legacy devices which are commonplace in ICSs. In this paper we aim to overcome these challenges through the combination of a passive network monitoring approach, and selective active monitoring based on attack vectors specific to an ICS context. We present the implementation of our IDS, SENAMI, for use with Siemens S7 devices. We evaluate the effectiveness of SENAMI in a comprehensive testbed environment, demonstrating validity of the proposed approach through the detection of purely passive attacks at a rate of 99\%, and active value tampering attacks at a rate of 81-93\%. Crucially, we reach recall values greater than 0.96, indicating few attack scenarios generating false negatives.},

In this paper it is shown that the state vector of a linear system can be reconstructed from observations of the system inputs and outputs. It is shown that the observer, which reconstructs the state vector, is itself a linear system whose complexity decreases as the number of output quantities available increases. The observer may be incorporated in the control of a system which does not have its state vector available for measurement. The observer supplies the state vector, but at the expense of adding poles to the over-all system.},

Novel monitoring solutions are desirable that take into account these differences. This paper presents a new approach for monitoring safety and security properties in industrial control systems.

Attackers that want to remain undetected can attempt to hide their manipulation of the system by following closely the expected behavior of the system, while injecting just enough false information at each time step to achieve their goals. In this work, we study if attack-detection can limit the impact of such stealthy attacks. We start with a comprehensive review of related work on attack detection schemes in the security and control systems community. We then show that many of those works use detection schemes that are not limiting the impact of stealthy attacks. We propose a new metric to measure the impact of stealthy attacks and how they relate to our selection on an upper bound on false alarms. We finally show that the impact of such attacks can be mitigated in several cases by the proper combination and configuration of detection schemes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms through simulations and experiments using real ICS testbeds and real ICS systems.},

In both cases, keeping data in memory can improve performance by an order of magnitude. To achieve fault tolerance efficiently, RDDs provide a restricted form of shared memory, based on coarse-grained transformations rather than fine-grained updates to shared state. However, we show that RDDs are expressive enough to capture a wide class of computations, including recent specialized programming models for iterative jobs, such as Pregel, and new applications that these models do not capture. We have implemented RDDs in a system called Spark, which we evaluate through a variety of user applications and benchmarks.},

An exploited vulnerability could affect production, damage the plant, and potentially put people at risk. To make them secure, various forms of third-party testing can be performed. However, because the firmware and hardware used in most PLCs is proprietary, firmware testing is difficult. The firmware code may be encrypted, compressed, and/or obfuscated. Even if the firmware is acquired, it is unlikely to run without the PLC because it depends too much on the hardware, which means testing is limited by the availability and processing speed of the PLC. To solve this problem, emulation could be used to speed up testing, but to properly emulate the behavior of the hardware, knowledge of peripheral device communication is required. In this work, we present a method to obtain the necessary information to emulate a proprietary PLC and run its firmware in an emulator, which to our knowledge has not been done before. We acquired the bootloader and firmware for a Siemens S7-1200 PLC and modeled the communication between the firmware and the peripheral devices using reverse engineering methods. The models were then implemented in the QEMU emulator. The end result is a partial emulation of the PLC, demonstrating that emulation of even a proprietary PLC is possible. The emulation shows the potential for future integration with a dynamic testing tool.},

While there are benefits, such as increased efficiency and new functionality, digitalization also introduces the risk of cyber-attacks to systems that support critical functions. A valuable target in these Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) are the Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) controlling the machinery that manages a physical process. PLCs have proven to be vulnerable to a range of cyber-attacks in the past; however, newer technologies such as embedded servers and virtualization have the potential to improve this situation and be used to monitor a PLC’s function. In this article, the implementation of a Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) for a modern PLC is described. This method uniquely makes use of native technologies on the PLC to monitor a dynamic simulated process in real time. Both the PLC’s integrity (checksum, file size, etc.) and the process control are monitored to determine whether the PLC has been compromised in a cyber-attack. The proposed solution detects a range of attacks, even when the PLC’s control logic is compromised and—unlike previous PLC HIDS methods—requires no modification of the underlying PLC technology.},

  abstract  = {Cyber-physical systems underpin many of our society’s critical infrastructures. Ensuring their cyber security is important and complex. A major activity in this regard is cyber security incident response, whose primary goal is to detect and mitigate cyber-attacks in order to ensure the continuity and resilience of services. For cyber-physical systems this is particularly challenging because it requires insights both from the cyber and physical (process) domains and the engagement of stakeholders that are not strictly concerned with cyber security. A technology that is receiving a lot of attention are digital twins – virtual representations of real-world (cyber-physical) systems. They can be used to support tasks such as estimating the state of a system and exploring the consequences of interventional activities (e.g., upgrades). In this paper, we examine the use of digital twins to support cyber security. Specifically, our novel contribution is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the types of activities and how different modalities of digital twin use can be applied to the phases of cyber security incident response. Building on this analysis, we propose a structured approach to enhancing cyber security playbooks for cyber-physical systems incident response with digital twins. Playbooks are an essential component of incident response, ensuring that multi-disciplinary teams are effective in responding to cyber security incidents; therefore, improvements in their execution can result in increased resilience. To illustrate our approach, we present its use for a playbook that is concerned with mitigating a cyber-attack to critical industrial equipment.},

  abstract  = {The release of AFL marked an important milestone in the area of software security testing, revitalizing fuzzing as a major research topic and spurring a large number of research studies that attempted to improve and evaluate the different aspects of the fuzzing pipeline.Many of these studies implemented their techniques by forking the AFL codebase. While this choice might seem appropriate at first, combining multiple forks into a single fuzzer requires a high engineering overhead, which hinders progress in the area and prevents fair and objective evaluations of different techniques. The highly fragmented landscape of the fuzzing ecosystem also prevents researchers from combining orthogonal techniques and makes it difficult for end users to adopt new prototype solutions.To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose LibAFL, a framework to build modular and reusable fuzzers. We discuss the different components generally used in fuzzing and map them to an extensible framework. LibAFL allows researchers and engineers to extend the core fuzzer pipeline and share their new components for further evaluations. As part of LibAFL, we integrated techniques from more than 20 previous works and conduct extensive experiments to show the benefit of our framework to combine and evaluate different approaches. We hope this can help to shed light on current advancements in fuzzing and provide a solid base for comparative and extensible research in the future.},

  abstract  = {Digital twins can address the problem of data scarcity during the training machine learning models, as they can be used to simulate and explore a range of process conditions and system states that are too difficult or dangerous to explore in real-world Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). Meanwhile, advances in industrial control systems technology have enabled increasingly complex functionality to be deployed on or near so-called edge devices, such as Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs).In this paper, we propose a methodology for training a machine learning model offline using data extracted from a digital twin, before converting the model for deployment on an edge device to perform anomaly detection. To examine the model’s suitability for anomaly detection, we execute several simulations of fault conditions. Results show that the model can successfully predict normal operations as well as identify faults and cyber-attacks. There is a negligible drop in performance on the edge device, when compared to executing the model on a personal computer, but it remains suitable for the application.},

  abstract  = {The Russo‒Ukrainian War provides important lessons for future armed conflicts and illustrates the prominent role that drone technology will play in the future. The drone has unequivocally moved from a peripheral piece of equipment to now serving as a central technology in modern warfare. The CMS report {\textquoteleft}Drones, the Russo-Ukrainian War, and the Future of Armed Conflict{\textquoteright} uses the Russo-Ukrainian War as a starting point to examine developments in the spread and use of drone technology and what it means for Denmark. The report is authored by Neil Renic and Johan Gr{\"o}ne Christensen and is published in collaboration with Dj{\o}f Forlag. Three trends in the proliferation and use of drones The report outlines three trends in the spread and use of drones. Firstly, the proliferation of drones is changing rapidly: in quantity, with an increasing number of state providers, recipients and available technologies; in quality, with the unprecedented, growing role of the private and public sectors; and in depth, with states recognising the importance of both a domestic industrial base and international trade links to ensure access to drone capabilities. Secondly, the battlefield use of drones is evolving with an increasing of mass-produced, low-cost commercial drones, which, due to their cost-effectiveness and ease of use, provide significant advantages in reconnaissance and combat operations. Thirdly, military AI, including autonomous drones, is rapidly evolving and has great military potential, but is also associated with a number of challenges, including moral and legal. Recommendations The central point of the report is that although drones have become central to modern warfare, they have limitations and cannot compensate for fundamental challenges on the battlefield, which may be due to poor logistics or weaknesses in force design, deployment or quality. From a Danish perspective, it is therefore important on the one hand not to underestimate the future role of drones in modern warfare and on the other hand not to overestimate their importance in a distorted {\textquoteleft}techno-optimism{\textquoteright} that obscures their very real limitations. Finally, the report formulates a set of recommendations that will enable Denmark to navigate a rapidly changing drone landscape.},
